## The Staff

### The Hotel Manager

Generally Unseen, portrayed as a looming, intimidating figure, but never specific. More like the feeling of a hurricane
that hasn't hit yet.

### The Concierge

Tim Curry-esque, very formal, very proper, somewhat menacing

### The Bellboy

A sycophant to the Concierge

### Housekeeping

A kind, androgynous individual or individuals (it's hard to tell) in hotel cleaning staff uniform. They may offer to
clean something for the party, removing it's magical effects (curse or blessing) and returning a mundane object after a
quick scrub with their cloth.

Doesn't get along with The Concierge or the Bellboy, but not an enemy, more mischief, less malice.

May be a multiple-person, you're never quite sure, you often see them walking away right from you in the distance as
they are also beginning to talk to you in your proximity.
