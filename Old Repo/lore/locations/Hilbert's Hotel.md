# Hilbert's Hotel

aka: The Infinite Hallway, Hilbert's Hotel, the Back Rooms. L'h√¥tel Hilbert.

Hilbert's Hotel is the centerpoint of the Infinite Dungeon, it was made my the Mad Wizard in his attempt to replicate
the "Cave Magic" that created the Gardens of Ynn and the Stygian Library. It is a strange, partial facsimile.

Getting to Hilbert's Hotel involves finding a place of temporary dwelling -- a Hotel, Motel, Inn or Tavern, etc -- and
looking for an out of place door often in the middle of the hall of rooms, that only appears once you walk past it, it
will have no opposite equivalent, and will appear in the space between two rooms. Place any key in the door and turn
counter clockwise. The door will open into either the foyer of Hilbert's Hotel (if you're lucky (DC20)), in which case the door
will still be available behind you and you may immediately return to the Real World, or -- vastly more likely, you'll
end up in a random [[Hilbert's Hallway]]

Exiting Hilbert's Hotel is not straightforward, and you must find an exit door. Fortunately, Hilbert's Hotel has exit
signs over some of the doors, unfortunately, these are often regional, meaning they don't necessarily look like an exit
sign, they may not be in a comprehensible language, they may use arcane or obtuse symbology, but sufficiently clever
adventurers may learn what they look like over time.

See [[staff-of-hilberts-hotel]] for details about the staff.


## The Mad Wizard's Invasion

The Hotel existed for all prior time, and into the infinite future. It was a transitway through realities and stored
entire subrealities within it. It's role was to maintain the binding between these realities, adjust their rotations to
ensure stability across the omniverse, and the role of each of the Staff was established to ensure this. To 'normal'
human eyes -- and even the eyes of advance magic users -- it appears as a 'normal' (if quite weird) hotel, but in
reality Hilbert's Hotel is a collosal Arcane Machine responsible for stitching reality together.

When the Mad Wizard arrived, those ancient, arcane processes began to break down as he corrupted parts of the Hotel into
his new "Infinite Dungeon"

Traipsing across the omniverse was not good for the Wizard's already flagging mental health, and what little was left
was consumed as he cherrypicked and rearranged worlds to form new subrealities and induce massive, unstable rotations
into the reality the players come from, which results in the players arriving at the [[Pleasantly Finite]] and finding
their way to the [[Infinite Dungeon]] in the first place.
