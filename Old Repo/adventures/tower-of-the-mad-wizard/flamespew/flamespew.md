# Flamespew

A tall, spindly, whirling flame coallesces out of various outlets in the floor of the room, finally conjoining into a
white-hot flame elemental in the middle of the room. It swings a long hooked lash of flame and smoke around the room and
over your heads, scything the air and leaving the stink of fuel and flame in your nose.
