## Mechanics

### Vents

Roll d6 equal to the number of vents. Determine the vent's state by the following table:

1. Vent is jammed shut.
2-4. Vent is open
5. Vent is closed but not jammed, this can additionally be done by the players as an action
6. Vent is open and steam is pouring out in a radius about the vent.

If all the vents are closed or jammed, the sum of the d6 is done as damage to the IM.

Otherwise, on the next turn, all open vents explode, splitting the damage of all those d6 evenly amongst all open vents.

There are 22 total vents, for every 3 die of damage through the vent, the radius of the explosion increases by 5'

so if all but 1 vent is open, there is a 35' radius 22d6 explosion, if 2 vents are open, it's 2 11d6 explosions with
radius of ~20'. Round up to the nearest square.

Creatures except for IM caught in the explosion can Dex Save for half.

IM is immune

If all the vents are shut, there is backpressure and the IM takes 22d6 damage.

Players can close the vents with an action, attack, or bonus action with a successful attack. Summoned Ants will try to
re-open any closed or jammed vents, the IM will summon 1 per jammed vent on each of it's turns and as an optional
legendary action after any players turn.

### Turrets

IM can summon turrets if the players did not connect the fuel line and reprogram them in the Skybridge Control Room. If
the players did not connect the fuel line, the IM supplies fuel to them and takes 2d6 self damage for each turret.
Turrets lose a percentage of remaining health per turn until they are under some threshold then they retreat. If a
player is able to bring a turret to negative 25% of it's total health before it has a chance to retreat, it permanently
dies.

If the players connected fuel but did not reprogram the turrets, the turrets do not cause damage to the IM and the
overall fame of the fight is increased.

If the players reprogrammed the turrets without fueling them, the IM will only summon them at most once, and will target
them preferentially to disable them again.

### Refuel

When the IM's health drops below 66%, it will return to it's starting position, connect to the surrounding vents, and
begin to absorb energy. It will regain some amount of health as a legendary action on each players turn. Players can
attempt to interrupt this by blocking the 8 steam vents around the IM.

As they block each vent, some number of Ant summons come up from other unclosed vents, if all vents are closed, then the
turrets will spawn and attempt to deflect the players, if the turrets are broken or reprogrammed, they just get to smack
the IM

### Flame Sweep

On it's turn, the IM may trigger a Flame Sweep, the arena is divided into 4 bands, the innermost (1st) band where the IM
starts, the others proceeding towards the entrance.

The Sweep proceeds in alternating direction on each players turn, if they are in a section, advance the sweep towards
them, it is a Wall of Flame that moves based on the difficulty of the current mode. It always moves towards the last
active player.

### Rapid Unplanned Disassembly

The defeat of the machine has destablized the structure, there is a door to the north you did not previously notice, it
is opening.

But wait -- the loot! What do you do?

1. Grab Something!
2. Run away

Every time you choose to grab something, roll against a progressing DC check, starting at 5, and adding 1 each time you
choose to grab something. If you fail, roll on the failure consequence table, if you succeed, roll and the GM will tell
you what you grabbed.

Players are encouraged to bullshit the GM, but the GM decides what is an appropriate skill check. If no skill is
appropriate but the GM likes the idea, the player can roll a luck check. If no skill is appropriate and the GM does not
like the idea, they may instruct the player to make a bad luck check.

A bad luck check comes in three flavors.

1. Bad day - Roll with disadvantage.
2. Bad week - Roll with a +5 to the DC and disadvantage
3. Bad time - Fail the roll outright, GM picks the consequence at their whim

So don't overdo it.

When you Run Away, make a Dex save against a DC of 10 + the number of things you're still carrying, if you fail, roll on
the failure consequence table, then save Dex again. Do this until you save.


Failure Consequence

1. You can't take it with you, you die.
2. A piece of the Infernal Machine severs 1d4 limbs.
3. A falling shard of glass slices your {left,right} {arm,leg}, you take 4d10 damage and are bleeding. Drop 1d2 held
   items.
4. You drop some of what you were carrying, lose 1d3 + 1 items
5. Something you picked up you assumed was dull, but was actually sharp, it poked you and you think it broke skin, take
   1d4 damage. Roll a Con save, on failure, you are bleeding.
6. You lucky duck, nothing bad happens.
7. A burst of unexpected steam burns you, take 2d6 damage; roll a Dex save, if you fail, drop 1d4 held items.
8. Roll twice on this table again, ignore this option.

Loot Table:

Each successive item of loot should be some bauble worth progressively more money. At DC5, it should be worth about 5%
of a level, then 6%, etc. This encourages players to keep digging, play with the progression till the players walk away
with XP sufficient for a level or so for a character at least. Ideally not all the players stay behind, maybe some
eventually cast shields or other spells to maximize loot withdrawl. At DC10, start making the consequences more frequent
by rolling twice on the consequence table. Then at DC15 roll four times, at DC20 the building collapses and all inside
perish.

For the actual items, describe bits and bobs of the machine itself, it's internals contain gold, rubies, and other
clockwork items that are probably worth a small fortune. There is also some obviously magical components to the
magically inclined that have significant value.
