A soft reboot whereby I brought the players to the actual module. We entered and the players got separated with D3
falling down the chute into Ansubek's chamber, he _almost_ managed to sneak out but got caught at the last minute. It
took some time for the others to catch up and a couple times he looked close to death. This caused the encounter with
Imey/The Last to not really work.

I wasn't able to get my mic effect stuff working this time, but I'm going to try it next time.

They split and Lazy Bastard ran into the room and saw the hole that D3 fell in and ran after them, ending up in the same
chamber. The rest of the party went through the dial room. A brief moment where Yotgraec dropped a copper piece down the
well of the dial of aten room, then onto fighting. I probably could've done better indicating the noise of the
fight/pointing them to the situation, but I was giddy at the thought of having split the party.

I need to be better about reading all the boss stuff; it's tricky with all the bosses still up, but I suspect it'll get
easier as I go. I also need to do some more experimenting w/ the Foundry plugins.

The fight with Ansubek also had an inadvertent nerf, because I had no good way to get back down the hall. I initially
chased them because I figured Ansubek would see it as a way to free his compatriots and queen and generally wasn't
expecting people to arrive. But in retrospect is was a big tactical loss. I think I'll have Kesi mention he was always
overreaching, that's why Anneke was successful in defeating him, she would taunt him (literally, she was a Bard) into
overextending.

After a very close fight where D3 was truly beaten to a pulp, it finally finished with an anticlimatic meow from the
Lazy Bastard after D3 did the majority of the work, aided by Yotgraec and the extremely overpowered Quinlin (some
bullshit critical role class... I think Serketraj will have something to do with that.

I suspect we'll probably do most of the fights next week, since Nehkbel is probably going to get talked down, and the
comfort with the system is growing.
