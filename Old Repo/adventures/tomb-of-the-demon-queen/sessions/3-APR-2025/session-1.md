[[abasi]] for details on Abasi's character.

1. Aim to establish, get to the tomb, explore some stuff, maybe get into the first boss fight.

Notes:

I forgot to have these open, so I wasn't able to refer to my prepped lines, which meant I didn't do a great Abasi.

We mostly fought with Foundry, didn't get to the tomb, but that's fine, it'll let me soft reboot.

I'm planning to do this, maybe then a monster hunter round with the same characters, that gives me a couple months to
flesh out some stuff for ID.

I just read about _The Gardens of Ynn_ and _The Stygian Library_ and they are right in line with what I want _ID_ to be.
They use a 'point-crawl'/'depth-crawl' system which I like a lot, and I think I can incorporate into ID. 

ID will be a depth-crawl system, where the majority of ID is a traditional depthcrawl through a traditional dungeon, but
it is _persistent_.

Other depth crawls tend to throw away the generated map, but ID won't, the intermediate rooms can refresh and change
over time, I'll track them in excalidraw to start. rooms branch off of others, and other depth-crawls can be included.

This will let me place 'raids' inside of more generic treasure crawling

I think I want to do ID in DCC to start, maybe, and just do some TOM combat there?
