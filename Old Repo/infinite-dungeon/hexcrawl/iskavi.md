1 'league' hexes (~3mi or 5km)

mostly broadleaf and evergreen forest, foothills, grasslands, and mountains

Mountains start about 10 leagues to the west, there is a large river about 10 leagues to the east that has it's closest
crossing a few dozen leagues to the north or south. There are no other towns, but many small hamlets and individual
lodgings. Lots of people live in the woods, few of them want visitors. Think the Maine Backwoods, Deep Appalachia,
The Backcountry.

The sort of people who live out here are weird.

There is the wizard's tower about 3 leagues away, it's visible from all of the surrounding area, making it relatively
hard to get too lost.

Matilda is a league east of the PF.

Primarily Wildlife Encounters, a few Weird Locals, maybe an old fort/cave/encampment, bandits, that kind of thing. Low
risk to a party with levels, not unreasonably dangerous for L0s.

Navigation is easy and getting lost if very unlikely.

Prep some generic forest maps, grasslands, etc. A cave map, maybe a fortress map

There should be not too much interesting here, very little Vesper or Gold, but maybe a bit. Mostly it's a place I can
drop things later and to give a sense of place.

Travel here is easy, and hexes are just big enough that players could easily miss something if I need to retcon
something in closeby later.
