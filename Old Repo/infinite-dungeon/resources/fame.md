Fame objects are also often useful/magic items. Instead of being worth gold, they are _also_ worth Fame, or a
combination thereof, some NPCs might want to buy an item, but won't have a lot of cash, so by giving them the item they
spread your clan legend, increasing Fame but reducing the amount of gold you get.

Fame is an intangible reward for great accomplishment, you earn fame when you defeat a great enemy, solve a mystery,
accomplish a great labor, or otherwise distinguish yourself as a member worth of legend in your clan. Fame is permanent,
but may also be permanently spent for both temporary and permanent rewards. 

When you created your character, I had you Iron-roll everything. This has certainly resulted in some auspicious
characters. They will live an interesting life already. No matter what they do, they will have been the _first_
character of your clan, for that, you all gain some base _fame_ -- 15 minutes, in fact.

You can use for _Fame_ to alter character creation from now on for members of this clan. You can use this to buy
advantage, allow stat swapping, etc. The GM will have a handout for you.

You don't have to make the decisions now, or indeed, until you are ready. Fame does not expire, and during playtesting
mulligans will be pretty freely allowed. That flexibility comes at the cost of on-the-spot nerfs if something is broken.

Some suggestions are in the `traits.toml` handout (or maybe it's rendered cousin if I've got that far), but feel free to
pitch whatever you'd like. The costs are relative, consider a cost of 1 to require spending 5 minutes of fame.

Fame can be lost if a particularly ignominious act occurs and you are facing dire consequences, the GM may offer you an
escape at the cost of some fame. You can also spend 5 minutes of fame at any time to reroll a die once, you must accept
the second result, you may only use this once per scene.

# Disorganized Notes

Fame in particular should be both a blessing and a curse -- every gold spent should give some Fame, Fame is
permanent until spent or taxed; spent on clan traits, to get benefits in game (trading on ones name, literally),
sacrificing permanent resources for temporary gains (e.g., spend Fame by throwing a fight to gain gold, or w/e).
Fame is the only resource attached to the _person_ playing the character via the clan sheet. XP can be traded or
pooled, Coin too, but Fame is personal and traverses across campaigns as part of the omniverse. Associated DMs can
allow other clans (but fresh characters) in their games as well.

As Fame is spent, it is paid to the GM, who can use it to spend on upgrading the fixture dungeons; adding more
monsters, enabling more features of the dungeon, etc. When they do this, they place new objects worth the Fame they
have spent in the dungeon; and the cycle completes. This can be used to trip up players leveling an alternate character
going to a 'simple' dungeon.

Fame should attract _problems_ of _proportional size_ to the player. Pool Fame by party, the aim should be to
provide, each session, an amount of Fame equal to some small digit percentage of their existing Fame. This is added
to the XP budget. This comes in the form of both useful and lore objects. Different books, letters, encounters, etc are
worth Fame, association with certain NPCs is worth Fame, etc.

Fame is gained only when an item is 'redeemed' in some way, so a book of lore may be worth thousands of Fame, but
it's also worth a free fireball cast every day, so maybe not worth the trade.

Fame is measured in 'minutes'

Gold brings some small amount of Fame, but it is lost as it is spent. Traits may require Fame 'upkeep' on every
character death, which taxes and reduces total Fame.

Fame essentially can be spent or 'invested' in traits, traits have up front cost (maybe in multiple currencies?) and
an upkeep cost; spent Fame is lost, upkeep Fame is _not_; you just have to hold that much in reserve. Total Fame
for a character is:

Fame points + k*Ducats + j*(XP in the character)

If a player dips below upkeep (maybe they spend a bunch of money or something), they must 'turn off' some traits (losing
their benefits) until they regain sufficient Fame.

XP is worth more fame (you're famous for your experience) than Gold (being famous for being rich is lame)

> ED: It could be interesting if this changed with alignment / was customizable in some way?
