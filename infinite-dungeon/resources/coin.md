Coin is simple, there is a single unit of currency, the 'Ducat', and they are small coins banded in steel containing
approximately 2.5 grams of gold. It is the standard unit of currency, there also exist bank notes for extremely large
amounts of currency, but these are seldom seen by normal folk. Ducats are the main currency, because of the prevalence
of magic purses, which can contain any amount of physical coin, and even reduce the weight of that coin. A Standard
Magic Purse reduces the weight of coin by a factor of 10, and only takes up a 1x1 slot in your backpack.
