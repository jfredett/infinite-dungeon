# Disorganized Notes

Players have a backpack with some number of slots, every item takes up a slot and some amount of weight.

Speaking of, Every player has a Backpack. The standard backpack all adventurers start with is a 6x9 backpack. Common
items such as magic purses, rations, health potions, and simple tools (including torches) take up 1x1 slots. Weapons
(including wands, staves, etc) and armor are 2x1. Other items have shapes as dictated by the GM. You cannot carry what
you cannot fit in your backpack or hold in your hands. You may not strap any additional items to your pack, the slots
account for all such clever feats.

Players may carry an amount of weight based on their relevant stats, items, and so on. The GM should adjust the weight
of things to align with their chosen system, the values given here may be used with the weights given in this document.

Weight is the primary means by which to avoid the 'rob a whole vault into your pocket' problem, a better way may be
preferable, maybe just a hard wallet limit like LoZ?
