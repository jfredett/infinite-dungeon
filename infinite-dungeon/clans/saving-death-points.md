Players can 'wager' death points on

# Beliefs

Also think like, Motto/Word/Saying

Beliefs that the PCs of that Clan should try to embody. When they believe they have done so,
at the end of session, the table resolves if the action described indeed represented the belief. If they do, the player
recieves the death points invested in the belief as a bonus. The GM Decides on an upper bound based on the percieved
difficulty of fulfilling the belief, gameplay effects, etc.

If a belief goes unfulfilled before, it loses 10% of invested death points

e.g.:

> "A Lannister always pays their debts." - Fulfilled when you pay a debt. 5DP
> "A good hobbit who never left home or did anything adventerous" - Fulfilled when you are a bad hobbit. 1DP
> "Dog Lovers" - Fulfilled when you John Wick some motherfuckers. 15DP

# Goals

Goals of the Clan are concrete goals that the members of the Clan want to accomplish, when they do, they provide an
increasing reward (compound interest) on the invested points. The GM decides the rate and cap on interest.

> "Recover our lost relic"
> "Discover my true ancestry"

Players should prepare these, and also have some idea of how to reveal the answer (subject to GM approval) to these
questions. For instance, if you have teh 'Recover our lost relic' goal, you should be prepared to tell relevant lore
about the relic. The GM will decide (with your consultation) the specifics of the mechanics of such a thing, but the
player is responsible for the lore.

Similarly, if you have the 'Dicover my true ancestry' goal, you should be prepared with some rough idea of what kind of
reveal you're looking for.

The goal is to provide your GM with hooks to help drive the story forward.

Goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound

# Interests

Interests are death point savings for the next character only. The dead player specifies something their new clan member
wants to learn, acquire, or other similar short term goal. If the new PC suceeds, they get their points back.

These should also be SMART, and subject to a limit on quantity and investment depending on their difficult. The table
resolves subject to GM veto on interests.


All other points that are unused are lost.

BIGs have a cost minimum based on the number of traits, player level, etc. TBD.
