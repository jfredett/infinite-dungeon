A trait is a property of a clan which specifies additional properties in-game or at character creation time.

Traits are limited by a few factors:

# Trait Limitations

## Trait Limit

Players are subject to a GM-determined "Trait Limit", this is a hard limit on the number of traits which may be active
on any one clan. It may also additionally limit the ability to keep, draw, or otherwise hold trait 'cards' between
characters.

By default, players should probably be limited to 5 total active traits and 5 total trait cards 'in hand'.

## Death Points

When a player dies, they convert their total acquired experience and gold into Death Points, these points can be used
to:

1. Draw from the Trait Deck for new traits (1 point per draw, with the cost increasing by 1 each draw).
2. Activate a trait on their clan by paying it's _Cost_
3. Purchasing Guild Formation/Upgrades
4. Unplanned future stuff.

Death Points are _lost_ at the end of new character creation, they are 'use or lose'

## Discard Rules and Drawbacks

The most common traits often have 'discard after' rules, which take effect when the describe situation occurs. Most
often this is "Discard after use" or "Discard after Death". Some may have more complicated "Discard after a failed roll"
or other rules.

Other cards have associated Drawbacks or Constraints. A trait that emphasizes your clan's warrior abilities may restrict
or hinder members that use magic or other means.

## One-time-use and Unique traits

A special case of discard rules is the 'one-time-use' trait, these are traits which can only be used once by a clan, and
when they are lost, they cannot be used again by that clan.

Similarly, a Unique trait is one that can only be in use by a single player's clan at any given time. If a unique trait
is lost (the clan is retired by the player, etc), the card goes back into the pool, if it is ever activated again, the
new player must explain how this clan is related to the old clan.

# Disabling/Discarding traits

When a player wants to make room for a new trait, they may need to deactivate an old one. They may do this by _paying
half the cost_ of the trait to remove it.

Some traits may be _permanent_, these traits _cannot be removed_ by the player.
