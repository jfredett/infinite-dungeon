The Mad Wizard is converting Hilbert's Hotel into his Infinite Dungeon, he is trying to steal the reality and make it
his own perpendicular reality so that he can learn how to manipulate all the realities using his new magic. Players
initially crawl in Hilbert's Hotel after defeating the Tower, they are perhaps told by Housekeeping, or some other
means, how the Hotel has been and is being ransacked by the MW to create his weird "Infinite Dungeon" using something
called "Perpendicular Cave Magic"

The Hotel part of the depth crawl is mostly weird but harmless stuff. Puzzles, information, etc. The depth crawl is
pretty small and is just intended to satisfy curiousity about the Hotel. At any point the `go deeper` can be replaced
with a trip to whatever set piece of the Infinite Dungeon you are currently running, or drop them back in the Foyer.

Blind running through the Hotel is extremely likely to return the players to the Foyer, the Hotel is actually a
relatively stable place, except for DDD's meddling.
