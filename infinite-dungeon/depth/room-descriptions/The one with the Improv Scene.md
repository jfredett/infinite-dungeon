You come into a room, several young people of various flavors are on stage, they introduce themselves as Matt, Smitty, Mark, Davis, Mat (one 't'), Paul, Chloe, Vic, Matty, Maddie, Mattie, Meg, and Mads. They work the players like an improv audience.

The Improv Troupe is a group of Bards who will, as the scene progresses, try to involve the players but berate them and eventually cast Vicious Mockery and openly and suddenly start attacking the players with Bard spells.

They are all, in fact, controlled by a hive-mind parasite, these are all former adventurers in the dungeon.
