# The Infinite Hallway

A long hallway, seemingly endless, but looping back after `2d100 + 10` doors are passed (on one side). When a player
enters a door, roll to see if:

1. The Door leads to another door in the hallway, 3d20 doors away, you can flip coins to decide which way and which side
   of the hall the door leads to. The effect is persistent, but it's reflexive only if it passes a DC15.
2. Leads to a subadventure/hook to another adventure. Totally arbitrary -- it may drop you in the middle of a forest
   with no way back, or it might just be a hall closet.
    - Including:
        - A Garden suitable for forming a door to the Garden of Ynn
        - A library with a door to The Stygian Library
        - A door marked 'The Machineworks' where the Machineworks Raid is
3. A Breakroom for minions
4. Another, different, Infinite Hallway
5.

etc.
