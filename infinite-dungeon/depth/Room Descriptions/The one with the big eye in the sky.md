> You enter a large open room, cathedral-like, with a domed roof and ornately decorated walls. Al-hambra style mosaic tiles, intricate stonework, perfectly aligned columns. As your eye trends upward past the massive altar at one end of the room, you look into the dome to see a massive, disembodied eye staring directly at you. It tracks you all as you move through the room. It blinks occasionally.

Nothing else happens, the Eye just looks at you. The room is completely harmless, there is no loot, it's actually a safe place to rest, but only mention that if the players ask.

They probably won't.

If one of the players shoots the eye, that player is instantaneously teleported to a room elsewhere in the dungeon. If another player shoots the eye, they are teleported to a _different_ room. I encourage the runner to make their deaths swift and painful.

Don't shoot the eye-bro.
