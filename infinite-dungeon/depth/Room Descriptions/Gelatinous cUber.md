> You enter a room with several large doors, about 3m x 4m, spaced about 1m apart, on long rails so they open up toward the ceiling. In one corner is a room in which sits a small human-shaped figure behind frosted glass, you can hear commotion as the figure frantically picks up and puts down various hand-sized devices and places them near their ear.
> In the center of the room are a number of large puddles of slimey resin, in the far corner, a large pile of it approximately 1m x 1m x 1m slowly, rhythmically pulsates.
> After a moment, you hear a seemingly disembodied voice coming from the large pile of slimey resin. "Eh, you need a ride somewhere? Youse need to get the app."
> The camera turns to see the party, above and behind you is a large sign that says, "Cuber" and below it a strange glyph that says, "Download the app today!"

The Gelatinous Cubes in this room are friendly, they'll give you a ride to any previously visited room of the Dungeon at a rate of 1gp/intervening room + 5gp flat rate per person transported. The figure behind the frosted glass never comes out, and there is no way in, the cubes are unsure who or what is behind the glass, and are unsure of what they do, but they seem very important.

One of the Cubes is Andy Kaufman. Not like an impression of them, the actual person, pretending to be a cube. 

Players can find elsewhere in the dungeon an artifact called the "S'am-soong", which is capable of scanning the strange glyph and giving them access to rides from the Cubes from anywhere in the dungeon, but the players must pay the fee for all rooms the cube travels. Similarly, as loot, players can find small, single use 1cm 'cuber cubes' which can be consumed to hail a ride like the 'S'am-soong'.

When the players use the service, roll 1d100, if you roll a 1 or 100, the 'driver' that takes them is just Andy trying to hold all their stuff. Everything somehow works as normal, but Andy seems pretty tired when it's all done. If you roll a 50, the players find some loot in the Cube, which the Cube doesn't mind if they take.

The Cubes all have names, try to take most of them from _Taxi_, or just give them generic New-Yawk-y names.
