Players may form a _Guild_. To form a guild they must first purchase a _Guildhall_ using Gold _and_ XP _and_ Death
Points.

Guildhalls may be upgraded up to three times, but some upgrades are mutually exclusive.

Characters may join any Guild by paying an entrance fee based on the upgrades that guild has.

Guild upgrades are powerful bonuses that require pooling resources from multiple players; but the result is a permanent
upgrade to the town that will persist for all future characters (that join the guild) and may improve other aspects for
all players unconditionally.
