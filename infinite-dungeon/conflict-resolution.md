At various points this guide will need to resolve some conflict. It uses specific terms to refer to a generic process of
resolution.

'the table resolves' means some pre-determined method in which the entire table is included in the decision making.

'the GM Decides' means the player currently GMing makes a fiat ruling. Unbound by any prior precedent, total authority.

These may be subject to condition, e.g.:

'the table resolves subject to GM Veto'

or

'the GM decides subject to unanimous table veto'
