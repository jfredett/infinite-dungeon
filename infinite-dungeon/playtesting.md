# Playtesting

We are going to try a bunch of different systems, the goal of ID is to be a meta-system, it's more about making chargen
more fun, and I want it to be fun with respect to lots of systems. I'll try not to skip around too much, but the goal is
to go through a few systems over time, starting with 5e.

Each playtest will be a self-contained instance of the Dungeon, after each playtest all 'lore' will be reset, all prior
lore is decanonized and only lore I re-introduce for that playtest will be valid. Similarly, all costs, available
upgrades, etc will be reset and all prior versions are decanonized.

tl;dr -- each playtest is a self-contained instance of the game, setting, and everything, and between tests nothing is
retained.

## Initial Playtest

The goal of this is going to be to flesh out the core 'Generic Chargen' system, and to test out the initial 'Raid'
environment. Players will enter the ID, discover Hilbert's Hotel and the Hallways, and eventually (relatively quickly)
find the raid environment. We'll do a few passes at it, do some tuning, then collect feedback. Death
Points/Renoun/whatever I end up calling it will be relatively freeform, but I'll likely run 5e for this iteration.
