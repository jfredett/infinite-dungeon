# Playtesting

We are going to try a bunch of different systems, the goal of ID is to be a meta-system, it's more about making chargen
more fun, and I want it to be fun with respect to lots of systems. I'll try not to skip around too much, but the goal is
to go through a few systems over time, starting with 5e.
