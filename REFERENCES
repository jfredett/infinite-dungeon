Infinite Dungeon is a system, setting, and campaign; while mostly these references have to do with _setting_, they
influence across all demense, so I list them here with some blurb as to how they're used. ID, as a campaign, is intended
to be a 'meta' campaign from which others flow and connect and interact, even across character and party death.

Much of the lore I write about the setting is designed as little snippets that can be used to seed other modules and
adventures and stuff, so that's what this is all for.

# Direct Reference or inclusion

These are primary, directly integrated sourcebooks and modules for the ID campaign setting and the system more
generally.

## Emmy Allen ("Cave Girl")

- The Garden of Ynn
- The Stygian Library

Referenced heavily throughout, too numerous to list. In all honesty Allen's work completely upended the plan I had, as
they found a significantly more elegant way to accomplish the shared goal. Buy everything they've made; it's all good.

Infinite Dungeon is, as best I can accomplish, a generalization in particular of the idea of a 'perpendicular' reality,
distinct from a parallel reality. This concept alone kept my brain spinning for several hours.

## FoundryVTT Team

- The Demon Queen

Used as an initial shakedown adventure, some adaptation from my end to incorporate elements form other books.

# Indirect Reference or consideration

These are secondary sources that I've consulted, maybe borrowed some ideas from, but haven't directly integrated into
the setting yet.
