He is unsure of his religion, it has been slowly dwindling in it's support over the years and he finally decided to venture to the tomb more out of a hope of finally proving his beliefs wrong. He is stunned to find it is all real.

  description: "Abasi is tall, broad shouldered, and muscular. His garb is simple, and light with no more armor than necessary to protect him. Though once bald and clean-shaven, a few day's growth of gray hair now betray his age. \n\nA network of scars cuts through his darkly tanned and weather worn skin, down his cheek, to neck and shoulders. It seems that this aging warrior's life has seen no shortage of battle, but unlike most who break under the stress of constant danger, he does not appear the least bit diminished by such trials. His eyes are the color of the morning dawn, and his gaze is stern. \n\nAt rest he is still, with the patient bearing of a hawk watching for prey."
