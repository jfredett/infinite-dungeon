  description: "Kesi is woman of modest stature but stark appearance. With a shaved head, garb that is a mixture of sky blue vestments, bronze scale armor, an excessive amount of jewelry, and a mace hung from her belt, it is impossible to identify her as any one thing. The countless acessories she wears are made up mostly of charms and icons of the various gods of the lands or mystical symbols, many of which are unfamiliar to contemporary eyes. Her every movement jingles noisily, yet she leaves no footprints where she walks."
