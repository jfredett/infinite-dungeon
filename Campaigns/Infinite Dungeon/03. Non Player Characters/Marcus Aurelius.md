Current _Senator primus inter pares_ of the SPQR, and thus leader of the [[Catholic Pantheon]]. Technically magical, as he is immortal and impervious at least to disease and has healed from every wound ever given to him, he acts as a sort of Philosopher King, leading the first and oldest non-magical organization with sufficient collective power to rival the magical warlords that ruled for so long.
