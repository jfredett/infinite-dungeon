> A gruff looking man with a long beard and worn features; he speaks in a rough eastern european accent and has an attitude that perfectly reflects the bombast and gregarious tone of that accent. He is the quintessential Innkeep, self-interested, slightly greedy, and over-the-top excited to send new adventurers off to their likely demise or glory. He appears generous, but his motivations are never quite clear and you always get the sense that he's up to something. A scoundrel, ruffian, a true and unmitigated rogue in the oldest sense of the term.
