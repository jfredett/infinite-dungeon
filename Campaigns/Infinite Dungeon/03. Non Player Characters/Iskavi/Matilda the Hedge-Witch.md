# Description

> A short woman with wide hips and hair that never seems to be the same color each time you meet her. She wears a wide brimmed had that arrives at a point, a coat-and-petticoats bound by a belt, her clothes seem to be mostly pockets. She always seems to have the tool or reagent to hand in one of these pockets. Glasses hang around her neck, a pair of garden gloves peek out of a pocket, and she seems to be constantly just a little bit dirty with fresh earth from a garden. She smells like whatever flowers are in bloom around her hut. Her voice is kind, low, and sweet; she seems very friendly, and her smile could deafen an unsuspecting stranger.
