> A dog-sized creature on six legs, it clearly can carry many times the average weight a human, even one of the sort, could carry. I has a boxy 'head' with a bulbous, glassy screen; strange green light glows from its... face? It does not appear to have any way to manipulate objects, and instead simply stands under an automated filler to receive it's charge. It marches inexorably towards it's goal and does not appear to pay you any regard, so long as you don't touch it.
