The encounter proceeds thus:

1. Determine total # of HD you have for the encounter depending on difficulty
2. Use actions to spend those hit die, the 'encounter' takes damage, but spawns monsters according to the hit die spent
3. Players must defeat the encounter to proceed.

In this encounter, the goal for the GM is to get as many Vesper Barrels from source to sink. The players need to stop them. Each barrel moved empowers the IM later.
