| 2   | marked with an inspection date from 30 years ago |
| 3   | engraved with warning runes                      |
| 4   | torn loose in the final explosion                |
| 5   | still reeking of burnt fuel                      |
| 6   | jammed between two pressure valves               |
| 7   | recovered from the remains of a fuelbot          |
| 8   | pried from a control console                     |
| 9   | tagged with a serial number in machine-code      |
| 10  | dented by a critical hit during battle           |
| 11  | cut free from a spinning assembly                |
| 12  | found embedded in the wall after the fight       |
| 13  | covered in ancient maintenance graffiti          |
| 14  | pulled from the wreckage of an ornithopter       |
| 15  | used to seal a steam leak in combat              |
| 16  | salvaged from the heart of the engine core       |
| 17  | burnt in the shape of a gear                     |
| 18  | adorned with the emblem of the Machine Cult      |
| 19  | plucked from a heap of melting slag              |
| 20  | bolted into a nest of fuel lines                 |
| 21  | scorched with fingerprints                       |
| 22  | rattles ominously when shaken                    |
| 23  | stuck to a burst pressure tank                   |
| 24  | pulled from the jaw of Flamespew                 |
| 25  | etched with tally marks                          |
| 26  | still vibrating slightly                         |
| 27  | pulled free with a terrible screech              |
| 28  | lined with tiny, melted ball bearings            |
| 29  | surprisingly intact                              |
| 30  | scorched into a near-artistic pattern            |
