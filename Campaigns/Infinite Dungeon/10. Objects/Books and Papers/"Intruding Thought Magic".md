> ED: An excerpt from one of the Mad Wizard's journals, written in common, which was unusual for his journals.

In the mind empty mind, mind over mind makes mind mind mines, mined minds make them mine.
Bury the mind in the mine, drill drill drill, drill to kill.
I combine the mine to mine the mind with time I'll dine on thine.
Intruder Intruder, won't you let me come in? I've got something to give them.

I weave the wires of withered thought,
none can tell what I have wrought.
Intruder, Intruder -- let me in.
I shall not give thee a chance again.

I whistle a whistling whistly tune.
Jump over Jabberwock and Sprithee Mistoon.
Swing from the Gumtree, dive in the lake.
Menace is coming, like crests in my wake.
