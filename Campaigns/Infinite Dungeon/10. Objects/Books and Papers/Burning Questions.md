Burning Questions is an Anthology series with names of the form:

`Burning Questions, Volume X, Issue Y: On <insert setting question here>`

These are given to players when they ask a question for which I do not have the answer. It appears, magically, in their inventory as a weightless book (and in Foundry as a Journal Entry). When I have an answer, I fill the book.

The books all have a similar frontispiece, detailing that this book is on loan from one of the following libraries:
