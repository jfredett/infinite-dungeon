I refer to prior writing toward the basic design and definition of a _Magick_, it is difficult to ensorcel an entire _Magick_ within any language or device contained _within_ said Magick, cf. _Goedel's_ fine work on the sub-system common, necessarily, to all _Magicks_, that of Mathematics. I shan't delve into these details here, but suffice that his result naturally generalizes to any sufficiently arcane Magick will itself be necessarily _Mysterious_ in the sense that were will always be phenomena for which we need to develop new methods of perception in order to understand. We see this frequently throughout the many ages; the development of Empathy, primarily, seems to be an inflection point in the Magick of this reality. At some point individuals within the Magick found ways to simulate and understand the emotional reality of others. Imperfectly, sure, and skill-dependent; as we rapidly discovered, but this _lesser magic_ -- this component that was found in the _greater Magick_ of this reality -- was able to begin to connect individual actors into communities and insodoing allowed for deeper and more fundamental understanding of the nature of our reality -- our understanding of _its Magick_, to be formed.

In review of the works delivered from the Majestic and Unparalleled [[Southron University of the Arcane Arts]], I was able to learn more about [[The Garden of Ynn]] mentioned in the Mad Wizard's Journals.

It seems as though this particular reality is Rotated with respect to, at least, our own reality. It claims that the [[The Garden of Ynn|Sidhe]], or perhaps an unknown predecessor to their kind, were responsible for the _construction_ of this reality, though it details none of the origin of it's raw material nor how this was accomplished. It seems that this grand experiment _worked_ for quite some time, a stable, orthogonal reality, attached to their primary Magick but _fundamentally altering_ parts of it to allow for different and deeper arcana to be explored.

The commentaries on the sent tomes include a work by an -- I assume -- pseudonymous author, "[[Parmadil]]", which contains a number of entries relating to various excursions into this domain, in particular it notes something the author refuses to name directly, but which appears to have utterly consumed a colleague.

> "He has drawn more today, they seem to pervade his thinking. This idea that has so consumed him has driven him to irrationality and despair. Daily he does not go up, but remains in his room, scrawling on every wall the image of thorn and thicket. He repeats endlessly, 'Seek the way, stray from the way, find it, find it, open air. I am rending, I am rent, I must find open air. Toiling toiling endlessly, I shall hew my way out with a bloody axe!'
>
> His mania, driven by this... idea -- this pervasive, invading, disease of an idea -- it is unlike any affliction, magical or mundane, I or my colleagues have seen before. Lacking a proper name for, what I believe, to be a magical ailment brought back from our excursions into Ynn, we have all taken to calling it, _The Idea of Thorns._

This... [[Parmadil]]... wrote this over two thousand years ago, I have sent for any additional writing by him or his compatriots, as well as an information about the nature of the afflicted's illness.

Based on what I have, he seems to have been encountering this class of disease for the first time. Fortunately, we have more information readily at our disposal; here at Oxford, I was able to find reference from another Scholar of a more recent century, in a collection of loose papers signed in the included script:

[ED: An image of a library with the letters `TA` embedded inside, the library is on fire in the image. I will reproduce `TA` in this transcription where this symbol appears, as Mithrandir uses it as a nominative when referring to the author's commentary on this referenced text.]

Here we see some terms introduced by reference to another work that the author refers to as "Neolithic Arcana", which strikes me as a perhaps more polite version of the madman's "Cave Magic".

The author here refers to what their reference calls "Memetic Virus", which seems to be some kind of magical manifestation of thought -- or a creature confined to the realm of pure thought. The author, `TA`, is hesitant to include details about how the the specific "Virus" works -- I assume they refer to the specific 'Idea of Thorns' [ED: hence `IoT`] -- out of fear of accidentally spreading the virus, the full warning, transliterated from the Aramaic.

> ED: I have spared the intermediate work that went on for several pages detailing the process of transliteration. The original work appears to have been in a dialect of Edomic in common use in 425BCE, or thereabouts. Coinciding with the a number of legends relating to extreme magical events taking place in and around that time, and the appearance of a so-called 'Demon Queen' who ruled as a tyrannical warlord in the region for some time. Mithrandir's final translation is reproduced below. A colleague has published elsewhere a treatise, "On a translation of Mithrandir the Wise of an Edomic passage", which may be found at the Lisbon University Library.

"The fear I possess over the loosing of the Thorn-Idea into this world should convey its menace. It destroyed the world of ancient and powerful Sidhe, it left them mad and maddening. Instead I form an Idea-of-Emptiness, and Unidea, which hurts not the body nor soul."

Here `TA` may be said to be speaking in metaphor, but I think his Idea-of-Emptiness may be more than that. As the Madman said in [["Intruding Thought Magic"]]:

> In the mind empty mind, mind over mind makes mind mind mines, mined minds make them mine.
> Bury the mind in the mine, drill drill drill, drill to kill.
> I combine the mine to mine the mind with time I'll dine on thine.
> Intruder Intruder, won't you let me come in? I've got something to give them.

Which, if we are generous with our interpretation, may be an attempt to convey the idea of a kind of magic that exists only as a mental trap or idea that, once conceived, poisons the mind in a way that destroys it. If such a thing were then given form and function to self-reproduce, such a thing would act like a disease, spreading through the minds of all who observe it.
