# Description

> You arrive at small hut in the middle of a loamy, slightly wet section of forest. Getting here involved trudging through marsh, muck, and mire. The stench of bog compost and rotted wood; it smells and feels wet. It's dank, and not necessarily in the fun way. There are surprisingly few stinging or pestering insects, though. There are definitely mosquitos, but they aren't particularly aggressive. The area feels and seems wild, but the more you look, the more intentional everything seems. {Nature Check DC15}{Success: On the way here, you noticed a number of vines and plants that do not appear native to this area, lots of trees being throttled and killed by them, in fact; here though, no invasives.}{Fail: All the trees here seem healthier, greener, and bigger than the trees on the way here.} The forest is mostly coniferous, but a few large swamp oaks and bog willow dot the path. The path itself is soft, mossy in spots, but never muddy.

> The hut is circular, approximately 30' (10m) in diameter. A set of steps lead up to the open entryway, you see a hearth and fire inside. A bright quilt of colorful fabrics is tied off to one side of the doorway. The stairs are wrapped in roots and lined with small flower blossoms. Improvised fencing surrounds a few raised beds on either side of the building. The roofline is improvised, the window locations are improvised, in fact, very few things here seem planned, everything has the essence of something grown.

# First Meeting

> Inside, you see a woman, a little over 5', flitting from place to place, humming as she works. Her hands are dirty, her hat, pointy, her dress - it has pockets, lots of pockets. She seems to have a pocket for everything. You see her randomly reach and always come out with exactly the tool she needs. One pocket has a trowel, another a corn knife, another her notebook, behind her ear, a pencil. She looks with an intent sort of uninterruptible focus as you approach, she does not notice you. When you {Passive Stealth, lowest in the party} take another step, you hear a creak and then a snap, and her focus breaks with a shock. She sees you, random adventurers, and the packages you bear from [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]], upon seeing the familiar markings she puts it all together and greets you, "Hello, I'm Matilda, you are?"
