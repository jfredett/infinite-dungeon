The region containing Iskavi, Odesa, and some terrain to explore. The main map for it is a 21mi hexmap, the only populated space as of right now is A07 [[Old Repo/infinite-dungeon/hexcrawl/iskavi|Iskavi]]

The region is part of the "Greater Carpathia", which is part of "Arcadia", a region containing an area roughly equivalent to the whole of Eastern Europe out to Ukraine, and down to Syria and the Levant. The geography is quite similar. The southernmost expanse is the region of Neheb, in roughly the position of Egypt, north of that is Edom, near the ancient location of Ugarit. Corinthia covers most of the Aegean Islands and southern Greek Peninsula; Thessaloniki and Maketon are the two states in northern greece and the balkans. Lower Carpathia north of them, then Upper Carpathia, then above that is Scythia
