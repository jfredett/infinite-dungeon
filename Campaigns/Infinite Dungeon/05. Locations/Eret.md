The whole world.

Eret is Earth, but with arbitrary, often contradictory changes to historical canon. This is a result of the meddlings of the [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir]] trying to mold Eret into his own twisted [["On Rotated Realities"|"Rotated" Reality]], like [[Ynn]] and the [[Stygian Library]], but subject to his own rules, designed to maximize his power at the cost of all life in the reality that contains Eret and every other reality he crashes it into.

On Eret, Magic never faded as it did on our Earth. No one is quite sure why Magic fades in any reality, but when it does, those realities tend to merge together, leading to great disagreement as different understandings of Magic and when Magic faded start to disagree. Some say it was 0AD, others say it was when the last Druid died, others still say it's when humanity finally left the ground and ventured to other planets. No one is ever sure.

It's known that magic is dual to technology, and in particular that technology progresses more slowly when magic remains present; in this reality, the technological reality is the mid to late 19th century of our Earth, but where the concept of the State evolved at this time on earth to exploit other parts and peoples of the Earth; in this world they evolved more defensively to deal with the hyper-powered, functionally immortal magical entities that wander around. The world is fundamentally and unavoidably more anarchic here, because sentient nuclear weapons wander freely; doing whatever they like.

Magic-users will always, therefore, be of concern to lay-people, though many lesser magicians exist, they are generally feared by 'normal' people living more mundane lives. It's not a xenophobic fear, but rather a fear as one has when in the presence of a wild animal -- unpredictable and deadly things naturally inspire concern. 

Most folks that adventurers interact with, however, are self-selected individuals who do not mind the inherent danger of interacting with those of the adventuring class, especially at low levels of Fame. Famous adventurers, and especially famous magic users, will inspire quite a bit more fear and obeisance from the lay public, even those typically more resilient to their presence.
