# Description

> Ringed by stands of Black Cherry, Ash, and Aspen; with Witchhazel and Goldenrod and Lilacs against the building and a small apple orchard and garden out in the field. The building sits in the middle of a small field, two stories and a basement that walks out into a recess of the hill. A large barn door opens to a patio, inside the sounds of clinking glasses and plucked strings. A bulletin board sits at the end of the patio and all manner of The Sort pass by and into here looking for work, board, or rest after weary and dangerous travel. Above the large double-barn-door entrance to the lowest level of the three-story building, a sign that reads "The Pleasantly Finite Tavern and Inn; est. 112CC, N.I.L."
