aka: The Infinite Hallway, Hilbert's Hotel, the Back Rooms. L'hôtel Hilbert.

Hilbert's Hotel is the centerpoint of the Infinite Dungeon, it was made my the Mad Wizard in his attempt to replicate
the "Cave Magic" that created the Gardens of Ynn and the Stygian Library. It is a strange, partial facsimile.

Getting to Hilbert's Hotel involves finding a place of temporary dwelling -- a Hotel, Motel, Inn or Tavern, etc -- and
looking for an out of place door often in the middle of the hall of rooms, that only appears once you walk past it, it
will have no opposite equivalent, and will appear in the space between two rooms. Place any key in the door and turn
counter clockwise. The door will open into either the foyer of Hilbert's Hotel (if you're lucky (DC20)), in which case the door
will still be available behind you and you may immediately return to the Real World, or -- vastly more likely, you'll
end up in a random [[Hilbert's Hallway]]

Exiting Hilbert's Hotel is not straightforward, and you must find an exit door. Fortunately, Hilbert's Hotel has exit
signs over some of the doors, unfortunately, these are often regional, meaning they don't necessarily look like an exit
sign, they may not be in a comprehensible language, they may use arcane or obtuse symbology, but sufficiently clever
adventurers may learn what they look like over time.

See [[staff-of-hilberts-hotel]] for details about the staff.
