# Description

> In the midst of these woods of dead and dying trees, where the earth is black not with richness and nutrients, but with oily blackness and untold seeping evil. There is a clearing, here, where the gnarled roots part and the thick, muddy earth give way to a stone circle about 50m in diameter. At it's center, a door, freestanding. Nothing surrounds it, nothing behind it, nothing in front. Emblazoned across the Doorjams is a repeating pattern of strange symbols:

> Image of said doorway, it contains Aramaic-encoded Elvish words, DC50 to translate, even if the speaker speaks the underlying language, the runes are part of [[Private Language of the Mad Wizard Dracul Dracthulu Dracthir]], as are the particular variations of the underlying language:
> _ulanwavanda_ -- "Infinite Prison" (Quenya)
> _arnediand_ -- "Endless Prison" (Sindarin)
> gaudur -- "Infernal Machine" (Sindarin)
> ghashgul -- "Flame Wraith" (Black Speech)
> ninniach -  "Sky-bridge" (Sindarin)
> helyanwe - "Sky-bridge" (Quenya)

> The door otherwise appears as a normal, stout wooden door. It has no other obvious markings or indications as to special or occult use. It's just a door in the middle of the scary woods, framed nicely so that the scary tower is in the background.
