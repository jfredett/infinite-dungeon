The Infernal Machine encounter is a multi-phase, multi-mode fight. It uses the Vesper gathered during the [[Loading Docks]] encounter to power extra abilities, spending that resource as it goes. At the end of each of it's turns, it will choose which mode to transition too over the remaining turn, performing a series of legendary actions to accomplish the mode change. There are three modes:

1. Stationary / "Turret" mode, where the IM sits still and shoots firebolts at the players
2. Mobile / "Melee" mode, where the IM runs around the room and slashes at players
3. Recovery / "Refuel" mode, where the IM runs to it's docking station and recharges at the cost of Vesper.

### Phase 1: The Infernal Machine

The Infernal Machine has three modes, below are described all the _Lair_ actions (mentioned in the statblock), but not IM's own actions.

## Mode 1: Turret


### Intro

IM is not active in the intro mode. The "Escape" sequence fires but it's a rocks-fall-on-you moment for all players. They walk out with 15m / fame per player; but retain none of their inventory or anything.
### Normal

#### Lair
##### Vent explosions

At the end of the IM's turn, roll `d6` , `d4`, and `d6`. Number each marked vent in each section and activate a 20' lightring around it. Next, roll `d3`, after that many turns, roll `d3` and trigger a cherry bomb from the column you roll.

So if you roll, e.g., `1,3,6`, you might mark the top-leftmost on the left column, the bottom rightmost in the center, and bottom-rightmost on the left. Then you roll a `2`, so after 2 turns, you trigger your legendary action and roll `d3` again to determine which column blows up.
##### Barrels

Assuming the [[Loading Docks]] and/or efforts at [[The Eye]] have failed to disable the fueling apparatus, then periodically ornithopters drop d6 barrels around the arena randomly. Roll d16 for each barrel, then roll d8 and d4 for cardinal direction and distance. Find the `nth` grate and place a barrel according to your roll. This will ensure they are likely to be triggering chain reactions when other things explode, which is the point. Players can proactively blow these up with a firebolt or other fire-based attack. Non-firebased attacks turn a 10' radius into grease, which alights if an explosion occurs and makes a difficult, dangerous fire terrain that will do damage on entry bar a save for half. The fire lasts for d3+1 turns. It only occurs if they destroy the barrel without exploding it. See the statblock(s) for details.

A barrel explosion just does a Cherry Bomb (a la [[Flamespew]]) damage.

### Heroic

#### Lair
##### Vent explosions

Roll 2 die for each vent.
##### Barrels

Double the number of barrels generated.

### Mythic

The IM assumes the powers of the [[Flamespew]] and adopts similar abilities, but with the addition that the blade might
occasionally advance by two sectors of the ring.

When this mode is active and the [[Loading Docks]] encounter was not completed in a way that turned off the system, at random throughout the fight a number of chemical barrels appear at random places around the arena.

The arena has 16 total 'vents' scattered around divided into a left half of 6, a right half of 6, a center column of 4, and the large throne area around the IM. In this mode, the IM sits in this throne and throws firebolts and cherry bombs a la [[Flamespew]] at similar difficulty, but also after a random player's turn, as a legendary action, the vents explode like a cherry bomb. If a barrel is impacted, they also explode like a cherry bomb. Different difficulties have different sizes/effects/number of barrels.

In this mode it has high saves but is weak to being extinguished. Savvy players might be able to use the environment to
their advantage.

## Mode 2: Mobile

The IM spits out mechanical legs and chases the party, making devastating multiattacks. In this mode it has resistance
to lots of things but poor saves. So it has to rely on it's legendary resistance pool to survive. Players can tax this
pool deliberately as another way to defeat the boss.

It summons Ants from the previous section in this mode at the end of every turn, 2d4 ants flood out as a
single unit.

In lower modes, no chemical barrels, ants instead, in higher modes, barrels too, and keep the vents exploding.

## Mode 3: Refuel

In this mode the IM returns to the center and activates a shield that takes 2d20 + 10 attacks to destroy. It can be
dealt 1/(number-of-cables) of it's total life by destroying any of the much weaker (100HP) cables that connect to it.
There are 3+1d4 cables total.

During this mode, the IM summons a flame spirit after every players turn until there are 2 for each player. They
relentlessly gang up on players in pairs

At the end of every round, the IM regains 10% of it's life total. This lasts for 1d6 rounds, determined when entered. If
the IM Overheals, it gains half as much temporary HP.

If the players manage to destroy all the cables, all the healing is lost and the IM is stunned for a round, and all
attacks on it automatically hit and are natural crits.

### Phase 2: Rapid Unplanned Disassembly

```ad-warning

This phase doesn't occur in intro mode, the ceiling just collapses and kills the players.

```

The defeat of the machine has destablized the structure, there is a door to the north you did not previously notice, it
is opening.

But wait -- the loot! What do you do?

1. Grab Something!
2. Run away

Every time you choose to grab something, roll against a progressing DC check, starting at 5, and adding 1 each time you
choose to grab something. If you fail, roll on the failure consequence table, if you succeed, roll and the GM will tell
you what you grabbed.

Players are encouraged to bullshit the GM, but the GM decides what is an appropriate skill check. If no skill is
appropriate but the GM likes the idea, the player can roll a luck check. If no skill is appropriate and the GM does not
like the idea, they may instruct the player to make a bad luck check.

A bad luck check comes in three flavors.

1. Bad day - Roll with disadvantage.
2. Bad week - Roll with a +5 to the DC and disadvantage
3. Bad time - Roll a size smaller die with disadvantage on the failure consequence table, immediately.

So don't overdo it.

When you Run Away, make a Dex save against a DC of 10 + the number of things you're still carrying, if you fail, roll on
the failure consequence table, then save Dex again. Do this until you save.


Failure Consequence

1. You can't take it with you, you die.
2. A piece of the Infernal Machine severs 1d4 limbs.
3. A falling shard of glass slices your {left,right} {arm, leg}, you take 4d10 damage and are bleeding. Drop 1d2 held
   items. Coins are kept in purses of at most 40 coins. Denominations cannot be changed until you are in town and there
   is a bank to do it at.
4. You drop some of what you were carrying, lose 1d3 + 1 items
5. Something you picked up you assumed was dull, but was actually sharp, it poked you and you think it broke skin, take
   1d4 damage. Roll a Con save, on failure, you are bleeding.
6. You lucky duck, nothing bad happens.
7. A burst of unexpected steam burns you, take 2d6 damage; roll a Dex save, if you fail, drop 1d4 held items.
8. Roll twice on this table again, ignore this option.

Loot Table:

Each successive item of loot should be some bauble worth progressively more money. At DC5, it should be worth about 5%
of a level, then 6%, etc. This encourages players to keep digging, play with the progression till the players walk away
with XP sufficient for a level or so for a character at least. Ideally not all the players stay behind, maybe some
eventually cast shields or other spells to maximize loot withdrawl. At DC10, start making the consequences more frequent
by rolling twice on the consequence table. Then at DC15 roll four times, at DC20 the building collapses and all inside
perish.

For the actual items, describe bits and bobs of the machine itself, it's internals contain gold, rubies, and other
clockwork items that are probably worth a small fortune. There is also some obviously magical components to the
magically inclined that have significant value.
