Giant bellows which have to be fixed in order to open the final door. These are only viewable through an observation and
control room; it contains a large mechanical computer that the players can use. All instructions are written in a
language the players can't understand, and it takes significant study time to unpack. This room only opens after the
other two bosses are defeated, and while it is safe to spend time there, the longer they spend the stronger the final
boss becomes. This is signposted by rumblings and other such things coming from back the way the players came.

The control facility itself is a massive skybridge that rings the facility, from the entry side, the players cannot see
into the main arena, but if they venture around it, they can eventually get a view and see the giant metal thing
starting to come to life below.

Players can use the computer to gain information about this part of the ID, learn what the machine is, etc, but the
computer doesn't have any information outside this section and just refers to a 'Permission Error' (albeit in the
unknown language).

Players can attempt to decipher the language using a relevant check at a very high difficulty requiring lots of study
over many sessions (if they survive), progress is reset if the player does not explicitly leave notes in a recoverable
location, though any unrecoverable notes are taken to the Stygian Library where they can be recovered.

Players can control an aspect of each of the three fights indirectly. They can de-activate the ornithopters, making the
`Refuel` phase not work at all, the IM won't ever use it. They can also activate the spiders, skipping the spider fight
entirely. Finally, they can ultimately gain full control of the facility, completely negating the rest of the dungeon and
allowing free loot of the IM with no risk to the structure. This enables the Mythic version of the encounter.
