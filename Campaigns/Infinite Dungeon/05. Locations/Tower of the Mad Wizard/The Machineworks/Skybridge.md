A long network of bridges branching off a main spiraling, ascending ramp to a massive control room at the top. This part plays like a short depth crawl.

Encounters here will pull from a "Reserve" from which XP, Ducats, and Fame are drawn when appropriate events are encountered. When the pool is exhausted, advance players to the top of the skybridge more rapidly. Otherwise let 'em dally.

| 9           | **Clockwork Taxidermist** - A polite, monocled machine is trying to preserve organic life in glass cylinders. It may mistake the party for "rare specimens."                                                                      |
| 10          | **Unstable Pressure Line** - A sealed pipe begins to hiss ominously. Without quick action, it may erupt into a superheated burst of steam or flame.                                                                               |
| 11          | **The Ticking Child** - A childlike construct counting down in a singsong voice. Something might happen when it hits zero.                                                                                                        |
| 12          | **Rogue Repair Spider** - A mechanical spider scuttles around, obsessively repairing broken objects... and disassembling anything else to do it.                                                                                  |
| 13          | **Rust Veins** - The floor is crisscrossed by organic-looking trails of red rust that pulse faintly, responding to motion.                                                                                                        |
| 14          | **Ghost in the Cogs** - A haunting melody plays from a distant gramophone. If followed, it leads to a spectral figure stuck in a gear-locked loop.                                                                                |
| 15          | **Jammed Conveyor Puzzle** - A blocked conveyor belt full of odd, half-made contraptions. Clearing it might reveal treasure... or activate something better left dormant.                                                         |
| 16          | **The Drowned Furnace** - A boiler room flooded with sludgy oil water, in which something large and serpentine lurks.                                                                                                             |
| 17          | **Sympathetic Gear** - A small, intelligent cog that vibrates sympathetically with other machines, whispering clues or riddles.                                                                                                   |
| 18          | **Static Lightning Storm** - A hallway flickers with building static electricity. Hair rises, metal sparks. Lightning may arc dangerously with the wrong movement.                                                                |
| 19          | **The Gear Archivist** - A data-storage construct offers lore, maps, or cryptic riddles in exchange for memories or sensory data.                                                                                                 |
| 20          | **Collapsed Scaffold** - The creaking of rusted metal precedes a sudden collapse. Navigating around it may require a risky climb or trigger an encounter below.                                                                   |
