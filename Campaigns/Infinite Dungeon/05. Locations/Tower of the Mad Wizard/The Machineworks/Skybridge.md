A long network of bridges branching off a main spiraling, ascending ramp to a massive control room at the top. This part plays like a short depth crawl.

Encounters here will pull from a "Reserve" from which XP, Ducats, and Fame are drawn when appropriate events are encountered. When the pool is exhausted, advance players to the top of the skybridge more rapidly. Otherwise let 'em dally.
