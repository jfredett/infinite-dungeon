# Description

A collection of [[G - Glossary#Mundane|Mundane]] folks living in a loose collection, farms build on cleared forest for a few leagues, with a settlement of houses and small workshops near the lake. The locals here fish, hunt, and farm in the western section of the area, and prefer not to be bothered by any of [[G - Glossary#The Sort|the sort]] that come around. They have their Inn, the [[Pleasantly Finite]], which they tolerate only because [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]] didn't really give them much choice, it seemed to pop up overnight.

# Facts

Iskavi is the name of the town, at campaign start, it is just what Nik calls the 'town' that contains his tavern, his house, and the Hedge Witch Matilda's Hut. As the campaign progresses, Players can build it up with various stuff. Eventually growing it into and around the PF itself. The main village is located about 10-15km west of the [[Pleasantly Finite]], and about 10-15km south of [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch]]'s

Located in a region known as [[Upper Carpathia]]

The villagers here broadly:

1. Dislike any and all adventurers on spec. It is hard to gain their trust, but may be possible if an adventurer can find a way to help them significantly.
2. Literally run inside their houses if the party shows up
3. Work their farms, live in houses scattered over the 3 hexes or so that make up the settled area, and otherwise just try to live their lives.

They'll occasionally report rumors to Nik, who then delivers them to the part on the bulletin board.
