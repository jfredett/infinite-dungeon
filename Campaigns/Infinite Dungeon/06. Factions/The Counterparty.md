Parallel to the players, a second group of characters should be maintained by the GM for each player, ideally using
another player's class as a template; creating a 'counterparty' that is the player's match; this counterparty is always
neutral-to-hostile; always in competetion with the main party, and can be used as a third antagonist to meddle in the
plans with the Hotel Staff or the MW.

They want the same thing the players want, the 'First Clear' of some new part of the ID, or the Tower (depending on
where the players are in the campaign)
