Formally known as "καθολικό πάνθεον της ανθρωπότητας", or the "Universal Pantheon of Mankind" or just the "Catholic Pantheon."

Formed by [[Marcus Aurelius]] in [[00. The Time Matrix|209CE]]. "Worship" (more like administration) is centered in [[Corinth]], and resembles a sort of secularized Catholic church. All the trappings of Catholicism are there, but with a religion based more out of Aurelius' personal philosophy. The Church uses Greek instead of Latin for it's liturgical language; but this is really only a practical consideration as the vast majority of _people_ in the region dominated by the Catholic Pantheon speak Greek at least a little. The Administrative component of the Pantheon still speaks Latin and is tightly integrated with the SPQR and Rome. 

Unlike the Catholic _Church_, the Pantheon is far more concerned with practical, secular issues -- feeding people, organizing them, and providing an entity capable as a unit of standing up to the various magical warlords that kept the world in chaos for millennia prior. The Pantheon was among the first organizations to seek out, identify, and 'contain' magical threats. This started out quite violent, as Aurelius, in his infinite practicality even in the face of decency, decided the safest thing to do would be to prevent them from ever getting any more powerful; later this developed into deporting and then training these individuals to work as a sort of magical army for the Pantheon. This grew further into a monastic system that was far less cruel, but no less corrupt. These orders would sequester magically inclined children, where they are then indoctrinated in whatever dogma their order inhabits, and then are sent as agents to work for the Pantheon's purposes, most often to curtail, prevent, and stymie the efforts of aforementioned Magical Warlords.

The Pantheon to most civilians is a force for unmitigated good. It's magical people doing magic _for_ them, it provides a social safety net, community, and general bulwark against the otherwise nasty, brutish, and short existence 'normal' people live in this reality. Civilians are generally unquestioningly 'religious' in this sense.

The pantheon is organized around the worship of 'Saints' -- mundane individuals who, nevertheless, achieve great feats of heroism. They include:
