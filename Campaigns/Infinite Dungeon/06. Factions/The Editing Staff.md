The Editing Staff refers to the following people:

1. The Editor, writes in the margins/interstitials with `[ED: something]` -- does a lot of the talking
2. The Translator, who works to translate the stuff `Mithrandir` and his interlocuters left untranslated.
3. The Copyist, who is responsible for making copies of these works.
