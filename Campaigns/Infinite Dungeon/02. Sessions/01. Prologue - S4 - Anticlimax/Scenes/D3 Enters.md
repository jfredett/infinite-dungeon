>There's a thing that Arthur C Clarke said: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic." I say the converse also holds: Any sufficiently arcane magic is indistinguishable from technology. [[The Last]] is made of magic, but magic evolves over time, and as it does, improvements are made, spells refined, techniques honed, and eventually what was a prototype of a prototype of a prototype that is The Last, we, in some sense, have The Current here with us. That's why [[Abasi]] and [[Kesi]] both asked [[D3-VAR]] to stay behind while the party went ahead. While they worked, [[D3-VAR]] let Kesi examine how he, a modern version of what they tried to build back then, works. Through this, and with some effort and application of tools both mundane and magical, they manage to get him running just as the commotion breaks out. D3 quickly gathers his gear and prepares, and runs off to danger. Behind him, The Last returns to the land of the living, and groans -- then screams -- to life as bright blue-green light forms behind his eyes. D3 turns and sees this just as he hits the halfway point between his comrades and the now-revived ancient Ushabti soldier.

>I wonder what he'll do?


I'll send that to D3's player (if I remember) before the next session so he can think on it a bit and we can get right into it.

The Last is still friendly, and will prevent D3 by fiat if needbe from harming him or Abasi or Kesi. He'll suggest he explain who he is after they deal with what's happening in the other room. Abasi and Kesi come and cast heals.

If D3 runs towards his comrades, Last will show up with Abasi a round or so after.
