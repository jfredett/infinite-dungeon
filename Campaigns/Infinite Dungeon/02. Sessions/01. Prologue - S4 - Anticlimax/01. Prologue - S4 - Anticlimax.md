# AAR

Anubhet - Took about another 1h
Neheb-Khalet, DQ - took 1h

The end of the adventure fizzled a bit, the second half feels a little tacked on. There are some missing mechanics that are mentioned but not explained, several typos. Overall I like the idea more than the implementation, but it did show off the Foundry stuff well and succeeded in convincing me to stick with it, at least for now.

Prepped for the next session, answered some questions about Fame and stuff.
