Wrap up agenda:
- Recap
- Hexcrawling is only available in the Iskavi Area right now, still working on bigger stuff.
- The Raid will be available in its full "Normal" mode as of the next session, it is harder than what we did this session, as I write this recap, I don't know with what timbre that fact will ring, but I imagine it will be loud.
- This area hex isn't empty, there is stuff besides the tower here.
- Content is broadly gated by the Raid, but you are not constrained to only do the raid, it is ultimately a puzzle you will need to solve.
- Vesper and Ducats are a closed system, if you spend them, I can give them back to you, once you've exhausted the pool, you won't get any more, you'll get Fame instead.
