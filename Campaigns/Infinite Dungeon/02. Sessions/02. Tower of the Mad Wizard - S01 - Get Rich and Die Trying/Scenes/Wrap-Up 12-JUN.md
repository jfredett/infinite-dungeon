Wrap up agenda:
- Recap
- Hexcrawling is only available in the Iskavi Area right now, still working on bigger stuff.
- The Raid will be available in its full "Normal" mode as of the next session, it is harder than what we did this session, as I write this recap, I don't know with what timbre that fact will ring, but I imagine it will be loud.
- This area hex isn't empty, there is stuff besides the tower here.
- Content is broadly gated by the Raid, but you are not constrained to only do the raid, it is ultimately a puzzle you will need to solve.
- Vesper and Ducats are a closed system, if you spend them, I can give them back to you, once you've exhausted the pool, you won't get any more, you'll get Fame instead.

# AAR

One player was frustrated by the chargen, and left early. I was also frustrated by it, 5e doesn't like being hacked like that, certainly not over a VTT.

I think I'm going to use a different system for the next session, here's the outline:

1. You can still iron roll if you like, such a character would, so long as it died an honorable death, be worth 60m of fame.
2. You can Standard Array, generating according to the normal 5e rules, a character of this kind is worth 30m of fame upon honorable death.
3. You can 4d6k3 for 15m of fame UHD
4. You can point buy with X points, but start with no intrinsic fame UHD. And must maintain a net modifier no greater than 4 (sum of all modifiers must be <=4)

When you make a character, it can use any official WOTC published material. If you want to use something outside that, we can work something out, but I'll need some time to absorb it before we can use it. Fame values for different characters subject to change.

"Upon Honorable Death" means "When you die in a way that isn't GM or player bullshit." GM bullshit is when I say, "Your Iron roll character has 1hp, you are stung by a bee, you die." and you get to reroll with no penalty, but also no reward. Player bullshit is where you roll a character and behave in _boring_ and reckless ways to get yourself killed. It is never bullshit if it's very funny.

Otherwise, the session went well, in particular the skybridge depth crawl worked great. The fights are way overtuned, as expected, but the macros worked well. The Flame arena is a little too big, I think I might scale it so it's effectively half as big. I should probably do the same w/ the IM arena, which should also improve the explosion radius situation. The macro still needs some work there, but I think it's good enough for now and they are a ways away from it anyway. I think Loading docks is a more likely near term.

I think the next place to focus is actually infrastructure, I want to get a wiki set up for them, and get foundry moved over. I might just huck a VM at it.
