Read Aloud:

> Strange things have been happening around [[Odesa]].
>
> A massive tower sprung out of the ground, overnight almost. It has no entrance -- or so say the few maddened adventurers who managed to get near it and return have said, usually before dying. Other strange buildings have appeared around the area as well, entrances that lead to places far outside the understanding of the mundane men and women who used to live here. Strange creatures now inhabit the lush woods and hills of this part of [[Upper Carpathia]].
> 
> [[Mithrandir|A strange, old man]] has left a warrant rewarding the first party to be able to find a way to enter the mysterious [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/The Tower of the Mad Wizard|Tower]].
>
> You come from all over the region, maybe as far as [[Elysia]], to the West, or [[Moab]] to the Southeast. You might come from [[Gog]] to the North East,  but most likely you are from somewhere in this geographic slice called [[Arcadia]], which contains everything from [[Neheb]] and [[Old Edom]] to the south, [[Anatolia]], [[Corinthia]], [[Scythia]], or anywhere in [[Upper Carpathia|Upper]] or [[Lower Carpathia]]. Our story is currently centered around the small town of [[Iskavi]] in [[Upper Carpathia]], where we find our unlikely band coming together at a bulletin board in front of a large, boxy building set into the top of a hill. Ringed by stands of Black Cherry, Ash, and Aspen, with Witchhazel and Goldenrod and Lilacs against the building and a small apple orchard and garden out in the field. The building sits in the middle of a small field, two stories and a basement that walks out into a recess of the hill. A large barn door opens to a patio, inside the sounds of clinking glasses and plucked strings. You stand before this board, facing south as dusk sets in, and see a tattered parchment that reads:
> ![[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/10. Objects/Letters, Postings, etc/Mithrandir's Warrant#Text|Mithrandir's Warrant]]

Provide the handout to the players.

> As you read, a large, hairy, lumbering man comes up to you and interrupts the party as they read: 
>
>> "You, you, you want drink or just read? Notice is old -- come inside and spend money." 
>
> He ushers you all inside, the tavern smells like fresh timber and beer. A local band is playing in the corner, there is some bustle, mostly adventurers. It is a little too warm, but the room is lively and there is a breeze coming through. You can smell the spring of trees and flowers outside. As you walk in, you see the upper floors, each window flickering with activity as their residents prepare to turn in. Above the barn door is a clearly-made-by-the-guy-ushering-you sign that reads "The Pleasantly Finite Tavern and Inn." with smaller text reading "est. 112CC, N.I.L."
> 
> Once inside, the man steps behind the bar in the back of the main dining area. The warmth of the hearth-fire stings the chill off your face as he introduces himself.
> 
> > "Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, welcome to the Pleasantly Finite, the finest establishment for the adventuring inclined this side of [[Odesa]], what do you want?"

Nik is there to answer questions, he mentions at least:

1. That the notice is old, a way to enter the Tower is just up the road, Nik really lucked out on the placement. The PF was struggling before. The Counterparty found it and are a little bit lauded, but Nik lucked out because he happened to be one of the closest entrepreneurial innkeeps that has set up shop here recently.
	1. "No no, there was other party; look like you a bit actually -- they found the way in a few weeks ago."
	2. Nik can mark the place that the other party ([[The Counterparty]]) entered on the map, it is in the dead forest near the entrance.
		1. The entrance is a single doorway standing in the middle of a large stone circle in a clearing in the dead woods; the door appears to have nothing behind it, but is inscribed with strange runes that look like the _INFINITE_DUNGEON_ logo thing. Or maybe it's an aramaic->elvish thing again, not sure.
	3. {Insight DC15} Nik makes it sound like there is more than one entrance.
	4. {Insight DC15} Nik isn't being honest about how much he knows about the fate of the other party.
2. Mention [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch]], who knows more about how the tower entrance works. Nik just knows how to get there, but doesn't have any intention of going himself.
	1. "Well, I have this" {a gesture to a set of boxes and bags of common supplies} "arrived for the Witch across the lake, she is strange, I do not like her."
3. Nik offers free room and board to the players, on the condition that he gets to keep their stuff if they don't come back. He shows a contract that allows for a next of kin to claim half of the value in gold and vesper so long as they show up within 30 calendar days. Nik complains that the damn government made him add that clause, Nik does not like the government.
	1. "Is simple, you stay here free, you go adventure, you die, I get your stuff."
	2. Passive Perception of 19 or an active, successful DC12 Insight check reveals he's lying, and that next-of-kin is entitled to 50%.
4. Nik points to the [[Dent and Ding Potions]] rack, he's thinking of just getting rid of it, so he's offering them free (for the first one) to everyone coming by.

Players can generally:

1. Go to [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/Tower of the Mad Wizard/The Machineworks|The Machineworks]]
    - First session is the Infernal Machine raid, in intro mode, maybe even in Black Knight mode (major permanent injury replacing death on failed death save)
2. Seek out more information from Matilda about the tower.
    - Tips the players to the [[The Secret Garden of Ynn]]
3. Ask Nik about something
    - See below for details, Nik is most likely who they will ask general setting questions
4. Explore other known areas for random encounters, local quests, etc. These offer minimal Fame, but do pay Gold and Vesper
    - Slot in a monster hunting module, or a simple hex crawl
    - Nik has a delivery he needs made to [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch]] across the lake. [[Deliver Items to Matilda]]
    - Nik points out [[Threeflower]] and mentions he had come in a week or two ago with some others, but he hasn't seen them in a while.
    - He finally notes that there is plenty of good hunting in the area and somewhat less intrepid characters might make a good living hunting and selling rations to other adventurers.

There are scenes in this session for those, but they may not get into all of them.

If the players don't attempt the tower in a session, roll d20 + number of missed attempts. DC30, no natural 20s. If at any point you pass, the reward from the raid is halved, the count reset, and the clock restarted. The first time this happens, the party is informed that the so-called 'Counterparty' claims to have defeated the encounter and brought back some various machinery and such from the tower as 'proof'. The machinery is genuine, but the claims are not, they stole this from the entry area, and this is obvious when the players actually go to the Raid; as the pipes are made of iron, and not copper as they are further in.
