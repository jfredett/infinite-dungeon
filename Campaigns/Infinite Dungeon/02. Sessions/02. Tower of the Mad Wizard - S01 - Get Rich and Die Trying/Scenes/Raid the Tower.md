Players Raid the Tower, they enter [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/Tower of the Mad Wizard/The Machineworks]] and can explore. In Intro Mode, the [[Infernal Machine]] does not happen, but the escape sequence does, but without loot or anything players run for the door, but they are all killed. 

As they are dying running toward the doorway, the camera flies through and emerges to see the massive black tower that was about a league away from the entrance to the Machineworks. There is a doorway at the top of the tower where the camera has been flying around, and we see the last character standing crawling through it and finally expiring at the top of the tower. A towering individual in dark robes floats down and finishes the character, then raises his arms and the tower continues to grow up around him, the room goes dark as the walls close in, and only the dark figures eyes remain glowing, staring into the camera.

Hard cut to a scene with [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]] collecting the players' things and setting them aside in a room _filled_ with similar stuff. He smirks and goes to greet some incoming customers (the players, again) giving the same spiel as started the thing, "You you... are you going to drink or just read?" Future encounters at the Machineworks will be in 'normal' mode, and include the final fight and full sequence.

> As you run through the door leading away from the crumbling infrastructure behind you; you see each of your companions fall. First a pipe takes out one, then a flying shard of glass slashes another. You persevere, you run, then crawl, then drag yourself through the portal that opened. You feel the sting of cold lash of wind whipping past your face, you struggle to look up. Looming above you, robes flapping in the gale, a dark cowl with bright blue-purple eyes and lightning-crooked staff looks down at you. The curl of a bearded lip shows through the shadows covering his face as he raises the staff and --

> The screen goes black, and a dark cackle is heard.

> The screen fades back in on an establishing shot of the PF, the lights flicker, another group of adventurers stand in front of the bulletin board. The camera follows Nik as he harangues them much the same way as he harangued you earlier. We see Nik head to the rooms he rented you after serving these other patrons, he gathers your things in a large basket and carries them up to the second floor, then into a hidden room at the top of the stairs. There is no door there, then there is; inside, stairs lead up to an attic space, Nik waves a hand and light appears, revealing a room, 40' by 25', with tall slanted ceilings, filled to the brim with shelves and shelves of adventuring gear.

> Nik mumbles something unintelligible, sets down the basket, and writes in a strange script in a logbook. He turns to leave with a smirk, the lights turn off, it's dark, more laughing is heard, you can't be sure who's it is.
