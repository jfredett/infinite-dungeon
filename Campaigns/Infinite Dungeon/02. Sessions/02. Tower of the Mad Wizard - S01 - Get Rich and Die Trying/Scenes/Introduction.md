Here's my goal:

1. Build the Shared Tablematic Universe for Playing Infinite Dungeon ("STUPID")
2. Test out the _Infinite Dungeon_ system incrementally

#1 involves playing a bunch of different modules across different games. The world will be explorable by a few different 'standard' mechanics, that will generally translate into modules. At various places, signposted submodules will appear detailing an adventure I have prepared, including details on how long it's expected to run, what system it's in, what the total rewards will look like, etc. You are welcome to use existing or new characters. The goal is to build up a large setting over time. The tone will range from total farce to utter seriousness, anything is on the table, everything is canon in the Infinite Dungeon.

#2 involves using the specific rules included in the Player's Manual I gave you after the last session. This has a bunch of mechanics that I asked you to read over, you don't need to know all of them, but we'll be using the Gameplay Loop described there and as we encounter each item we'll consult the relevant subsystem. I appreciate feedback on how the systems feel, I've been mucking around with most of them for a long time, this represents the 'best' of what I've come up with over the years, but I am sure it needs a lot of tuning. Eventually I expect this to be a full system, but I'm working on the components piecemeal and will introduce them in various subadventures/subcampaigns of the broader STUPID.

I expect the following things:

1. Your characters will die, probably a lot.
2. You'll probably want to run more than one character at a time, rarely simultaneously in a session, but probably you'll jump between characters a bit.
3. You _may_ want to run more than one _order_, or deal with Schisms within your order
4. Most adventures will be from 6-10 sessions before concluding
5. Most characters will only go on a few adventures before retiring.

The game is explicitly longitudinal, it's meant to be played in chunks over a long time, and not every chunk will necessarily connect to every other, or even the broader story at all.

So, tl;dr:

1. You're going to play in a shared universe that will span multiple adventures, campaigns, and even systems.
2. We're using all my homebrew bullshit over 5e for now, later there will be subadventures that use other systems, and we'll use my homebrew bullshit there too.
3. There are some quests available to do right now

Let's take the nickel tour:

Then move to Mithrandir's Warrant.
