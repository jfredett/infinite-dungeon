[[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]] has a shipment of... well he hasn't opened it and doesn't intend to based on the smell. It's for the local Hedge Witch, [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch|Maltilda]], her porters frequently refuse to deliver things to her swamp, so they leave them here and he has them sent over by adventurers for a few ducats. It's not particularly dangerous, just local fauna. The package weighs about 10kg, and must be borne by a single individual, it's on a small cart, and could be pulled by an animal.
