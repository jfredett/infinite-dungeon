Players will probably fight some of the ushabti first, these give big buffs to anubhet, so probably he'll come rushing out. Book says 'fierce and aggressive' and wants to fight with allies. Risks early are good, and especially to protect the corrupted minions

20' walk speed is quite slow though, so probably fine to dash him for the first couple turns.
