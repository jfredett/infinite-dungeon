- Details about the Last
	- Kesi is getting her self together, but still needs rest, she remembers the layout and has drawn a rough map for the players.
	- Abasi is trying to figure out how Last works, he thinks he can be repaired.
		- He mentions how complicated the magicks are around different parts, but he thinks he's got the eyes working, which is progress. They were pretty simple for what is otherwise a self-sustaining animated creature, a kind of magic he did not think was possible.
	- Kesi doesn't know much about the Ushabti exactly, but suggests the path to Nekbel Amun was the same way to the workshop where spare parts were kept
		- She does mention that they 'Never got the eyes right', but that they 'hear like Stygian Bats' and this is part of why they never gained more widespread use as a weapon against DQ.
	- She suggests the other direction was where one of the main barracks was located for them. There might be useful tools there
		- Last gets more agitated at that suggestion (passive insight check)
	- Regardless of where they go, they will find tools
- More details about Serketraj
	- Readalouds


At this point they'll know what leads where, they'll have the subquest about the Last, and it'll just be 'go kill stuff.'

If I'm lucky, this will be all of the remaining first layer bosses, and leave just DQ for the next session.
