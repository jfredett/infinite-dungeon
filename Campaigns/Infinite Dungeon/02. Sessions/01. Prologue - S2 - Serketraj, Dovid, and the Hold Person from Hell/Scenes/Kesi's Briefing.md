## General Information About the Generals

Kesi is willing to provide **surface-level context** about each of the known generals. Full lore dumps (read-aloud text or deep character info) will only come after they are confronted or defeated.
### Ansubek (Defeated)

- **Elemental monstrosity** originally from the **Plane of Water**.
- Escaped to the Prime Material Plane and terrorized the region.
- Joined Nehebkalat during her original conquest.
- **Violent, unhinged**, obsessed with **combat and consumption**.
- Commanded water elementals and creatures from the deep.
- Was responsible for controlling rivers, ports, and naval raids.
- Kesi is **shocked** to learn that the party managed to defeat him.
- She warns that **Ansubek may not be truly dead** — if Nehebkalat rises, her generals could be restored.
### Anneke – The Sarcophagus of Dawn
- Tied to another “read-aloud” reveal in the tomb.
- Kesi can acknowledge her name and role but gives only **partial info** until her sarcophagus is opened or she is awakened/defeated.
### Nekbel Amun
- Known for being a **deal-maker**, **sly**, and **manipulative**.
- Not particularly violent — more the type to operate through contracts and betrayal.
- Referred to as **untrustworthy** but not overtly hostile.
- This is the kind of minimal flavor Kesi gives for other generals unless directly asked.
## Serketraj

- High level from her section
- Known for violence
- Black Ops
## Anhubet

- Minister of War, Commander in Chief of DQ's armies.
- Animated Statues and Gargoyles around the Empire from a great distance, a sort of 'big brother' energy.

## Information About the Sarcophagi

- Kesi believes the other sarcophagi contain **Nehebkalat's commanders** and possibly **powerful figures** from the ruling order.
- Some may be **her superiors or patrons**, buried alongside the generals as part of the **magical seal** keeping Nehebkalat asleep.
- She knows **the seals are failing** — the presence of life among the tombs is proof enough.

## The Scepters

Kesi will also introduce the mechanic of the **four scepters**:

- The **scepters are key to progressing** through the tomb complex.
- Each is located in a sealed sarcophagus chamber.
- The party will need to **open these tombs**, either solving puzzles or confronting what lies within.
- This should be the **prompt** that pushes the group to **explore the remaining tombs**.

  description: "- The figure under the sheet is Kesi, an ancient member of Abasi's Order.\n- She, with her comrades and leaders, were magically entombed to act as guards.\n- She appears to be the only one who's magic remained functional\n- She explains that in each of the various tombs one of Nehebkhalet's General's was entombed with one of the Eye's of Aten -- the leaders of her and Abasi's order.\n- The Eyes were powerful members of the order who were locked in eternal battle with the Generals.\n- Kesi will be amazed that the party defeated Ansubek, and ask if Anneke's tomb was intact, if the magic was still in place. You will all head back to the tomb to inspect, she walks slowly, and explains the Dial of Aten on the way."
