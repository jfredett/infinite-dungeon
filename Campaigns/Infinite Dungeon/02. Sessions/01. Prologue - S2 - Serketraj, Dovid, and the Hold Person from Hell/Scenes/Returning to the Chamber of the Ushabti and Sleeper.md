  description: "# Returning to the Chamber\n\nYou’re in the chamber where you've just defeated the massive alligator-like creature Ansubek. The fight is over. You're standing with **Abasi** near the sarcophagus when he suddenly straightens up and says, panicked:\n\n> **\"We have to go back to the Ushabti. We have to go back to the other room. He’ll know what to do.\"**\n## The Walk Back\n\nAs you head back — a few hundred feet — Abasi begins to unravel.\n\nDuring the fight, he was running on instinct. Now that it's over, he's processing everything and **starting to fall apart**. On the way, he rambles — fragments of lore, unfiltered thoughts, anxious muttering. \n\nYou can try a **History** or **Insight check** to make sense of his lore-dump.\n\n### What You Piece Together\n\n- Abasi is the **last of his order**.\n- He came here expecting the legends to be false. His plan was to verify that it was all superstition and move on.\n- But everything he thought was myth is turning out to be **true**.\n- He encountered bandits — nothing unusual — but then found the **tomb**, the **obelisk**, and now fought a monster straight out of legend.\n- To him, this was like fighting **Sauron** or **Lord Zedd** — an enemy from children’s stories.\n- He has now also seen the **Ushabti**, legendary stone warriors said to defend the world from an ancient evil queen.\n\n## Return to the Ushabti Room\n\nThe **Ushabti** is still repeating:\n\n> **\"I am the first. I am the last. Protect the sleeper.\"**\n\nBehind him lies a figure under a sheet — **alive**, **breathing**, but **inaccessible**. The Ushabti does **not let anyone approach**.\nYou’ve tried. You’ve failed. You're professional inventors, but **he is simply better**.\nWhen **Abasi enters**, the Ushabti turns toward him. It recognizes his **order’s markings**, and this seems to matter."
