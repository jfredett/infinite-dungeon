Nik interrupts the party as they read, "You, you, you want drink or just read? Notice is old -- come inside and spend money." He ushers them inside, the tavern smells like fresh timber and beer. A local band is playing in the corner, there is some bustle, mostly adventurers. It is a little too warm, but the room is lively and there is a breeze coming through. You can smell the spring of trees and flowers outside.

Nik is there to answer questions, he mentions at least:

1. That the notice is old, a way to enter the Tower is just up the road, Nik really lucked out on the placement. The PF was struggling before. The Counterparty found it and are a little bit lauded, but Nik lucked out because he happened to be one of the closest entrepreneurial innkeeps that has set up shop here recently.
2. Mention [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch]], who knows more about how the tower entrance works. Nik just knows how to get there, but doesn't have any intention of going himself.
3. Nik offers free room and board to the players, on the condition that he gets to keep their stuff if they don't come back. He shows a contract that allows for a next of kin to claim half of the value in gold and vesper so long as they show up within 30 calendar days. Nik complains that the damn government made him add that clause, Nik does not like the government.

Players can generally:

1. Go to a Raid in the Tower
    - First session is the Infernal Machine raid, in intro mode, maybe even in Black Knight mode (major permanent injury replacing death on failed death save)
2. Seek out more information from Matilda about the tower.
    - Tips the players to the [[The Secret Garden of Ynn]]
3. Ask Nik about something
    - See below for details, Nik is most likely who they will ask general setting questions
4. Explore other known areas for random encounters, local quests, etc. These offer minimal Fame, but do pay Gold and Vesper
    - Slot in a monster hunting module, or a simple hex crawl
    - Nik has a delivery he needs made to [[Matilda the Hedge-Witch]] across the lake. [[Deliver Items to Matilda]]
    - Nik points out [[Threeflower]] and mentions he had come in a week or two ago with some others, but he hasn't seen them in a while.

There are scenes in this session for those, but they may not get into all of them.

If the players don't attempt the tower in a session, roll d20 + number of missed attempts. DC30, no natural 20s. If at any point you pass, the reward from the raid is halved, the count reset, and the clock restarted. The first time this happens, the party is informed that the so-called 'Counterparty' claims to have defeated the encounter and brought back some various machinery and such from the tower as 'proof'. The machinery is genuine, but the claims are not, they stole this from the entry area, and this is obvious when the players actually go to the Raid; as the pipes are made of iron, and not copper as they are further in.
