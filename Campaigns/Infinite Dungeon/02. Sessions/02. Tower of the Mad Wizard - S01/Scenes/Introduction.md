Introduce [[Orders]], [[Fame]], [[Ducats]], [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/09. Subplots/Vesper|Vesper]], and the general gameplay loop.

## What are we doing?

I've been building a system for a while, off and on, and I've recently honed in on exactly what it is I want to build.

Brennan Lee Mulligan once noted that the reason he used 5e for his narrative heavy campaigns is specifically because it _mechanized the components he was least interested in_ so he could focus on the parts he wanted the most control over. I have a different set of preferences than Brennan, but the same mentality. I _hate_ how character generation and progression work. It is so much work for a GM to maintain balance in a long running game, and the only tool that GMs typically have to deal with an overpowered character is building a bullshit encounter that is _way_ to hard that kills the problem character; or arbitrary nerfing. Both of these things suck, they lead to pain for the GM who has to figure out all sorts of ways to challenge players, but whenever they overdo it, everyone gets punished.

The problem, fundamentally, is that it sucks for a character to die. _Even though_ one of the most fun parts of TTRPGs is character creation, it sucks because all this effort that goes into building up a character is lost, there is no benefit to character _death_, for anyone, other than some narrative satisfaction.

How to solve this?

Resources. In particular, breaking up traditional XP into [[Ducats]] (replacing gold), [[Vesper]] (replacing XP), and a new resource, [[Fame]]. Each is spent in different ways and at different levels, and all the resources are _diegetic_, meaning they exist physically within the game world, your characters know about them, and they can be used for multiple things. Ducats are spent on things money is typically spent on, Vesper is liquid experience that can be used to complete projects, level up your character, or simply stored for later use. It's also explosive.

Fame is the most important resource. It is spent to buy [[Traits]] for your [[Orders|Order]]. An Order is a particular set of rules used to generate characters in the underlying system. In that system, you reduce character creation initially to a completely random process. You generate a character, which starts with 15m of fame as a base. As that character accomplishes great deeds, discovers lost artifacts, or otherwise earns it (at the GMs discretion), they will gain more Fame. When the character dies, that Fame may be _spent_ to add new traits to ones order, or activate traits for the next character generated. A new character is generated subject to the rules of it's Order, and the process repeats. Spent fame is pooled by the GM, who then uses it to upgrade old content, progress factions, create new stuff, etc.

## What do you need to do?

Start thinking about what you want your [[Orders]] to look like, you won't have to create one until after the initial missions, but it's good to have some idea. It could be a clan of related people, a military faction, whatever. I've already generated valid characters for each of you for this session, since they are fully random, I'll have you all roll a d20 and claim whichever you land on, if two people match, I'll copy the sheet. If you'd like to roll one yourself, that's fine, here are the initial rules for 5e.

1. Roll stats as 3d6, in order.
2. Roll for class from the PHB2024 guide only.
3. Roll for background
4. Roll for hitpoints
5. If your net modifier is < -6, your character is nonviable and you may reroll if you like.
6. You have no equipment beyond clothes, a simple weapon/focus/etc, simple adventuring gear, and 3 days of rations.

We're going to take a slightly on-rails tour of everything, and then you will be left to your own devices. This session will cap off with a visit to the [[Raid]], which I'll talk about more when we get there.

Full disclosure, these characters are _designed_ not to survive. If I have not killed them by the end of the session, I have failed you, so please behave recklessly.
## Phases

My testing is going to proceed in phases, I'll introduce a subsystem, we'll do some initial sessions with it to get familiar and kick the tires. I may tweak some stuff, and once it's settled a bit, I'll move on to the next phase where we'll add another subsystem and repeat. I'll do this till I've got everything in place, and then proceed to balance and refine. Periodically, you should expect some short surveys so I can gather some data about how things are going / bits you like or don't like, etc.
