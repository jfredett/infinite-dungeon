# AAR

I ended up having Nehkbel run away, because I want to have him come around in a future campaign. I only cast Power Word: Pain as a parting shot. I think I'm going to have an adventure where Nehkbel shows up in ID, as usually, aligning himself with power. Maybe MW has cured his vulture-form and now he's up to no good.

D3's player had to deal with another issue, and so had to leave for the Anhubet fight, so I had to rebalance on the fly since he represents a lot of tanking potential for the party. We ended up leaving it at the top of the turn order after they'd dispatched the mooks and got onto the boss.
