Nehkbel tries to convince the players he was just an opportunist, trying to survive in DQ's regime, he didn't want to do anything bad necessarily, he was just a business man doing business. Maybe he was in a relationship w/ DQ and it went sour but he was stuck because she was literally QBOTU

Sort of a New Yawk/Jersey-adjacent accent, very Sopranos, very Guido. If I could do a Gandolfini, I'd do a Gandolfini

For a fight, open up the following:

- Legendary Actions
	1. Scavenge Magic -- watch for Dovid and Yot to drop concentration
	2. Wake of Shadows
- Spells
	1. Confusion
	2. Gust of Wind
	3. Eldritch Blast
- Lair Actions
	- Wake of Shadows
	- Pit of the Blind

Generally use Wake until saturated or when the swarms need a heal. Nehkbel runs and uses spells like the listed to keep players at bay. EB as general move, trying to pull creatures into the pit. If a creature resists regularly, he'll use Gust or other technique to try to get them in the pit. If there are at least 2 creatures in the pit, Nehkbel goes nuts trying to burn them.

He's level 13, so he gets three EB targets/turn

Remember Lair Actions need their own initiative (they have initiative 20).
