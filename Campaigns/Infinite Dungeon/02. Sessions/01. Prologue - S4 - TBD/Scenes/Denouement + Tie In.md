After DQ, distribute the loot, then have a readout that ties in Infinite Dungeon proper (i.e., [[02. Tower of the Mad Wizard - S01 - Get Rich and Die Trying]]).

Read Aloud (Notes), End of Session.

1. Okay, for the next session, let's talk about what I have planned.
2. I'm working on a system, it's a three-legged thing, and I've got 1 of the legs I want to start testing. I'm going to graft that onto 5e and we're going to test it out.
3. I've sent you a 20ish page document you _do not need to fully understand or internalize_, skim it, get the gist, pay attention mostly to the first two chapters and read the bits about "BIGs" in the section on 'Orders'. We'll go over how it works as we use it.
4. What I need most is you to think about the BIGs for your Order. You'll be playing many characters from this order, by the end of next session we will know which character _founded_ this order (for whatever value of 'founded' you like).
5. The campaign will be a 'West Marches' style campaign. I'm going to run a bimonthly session at the same times, but your characters will have their own interpretations of the BIGs of their order, and you may therefore want to do something to progress a project or pursue one of those goals. You are more than welcome to organize a party and work out a specific session time. I am happy to run literally anything you like, the goal of _Infinite Dungeon_ is to provide a sort of 'Shared Tablematic Universe of Playing Infinite Dungeon', or "STUPID", where lots of different games can run. We'll work out the details of what needs to go into that session and how long I'll need to prepare for it.

We're at the 'create a character' stage, you have no fame to start, so they're random. We're going to play a bit of an on-rails thing, meet some characters, establish the world. At the end, if you haven't already done so, you'll die, but this time it'll be different, that character will be _famous_, they're the founder of your order. You can name them if you like, or give them a title, whatever, but they're the first member of this new organization that will go on to do whatever it is you set out to do.

The first thing we'll need to do is establish your goals, and then we'll get to pursuing them. Part of the railroad tour were some off-the-shelf quests, I recommend _everyone_ takes a goal of "Establish Ourselves in Iskavi" as a goal to start. It's good to have one or two goals to start, later you might have many simultaneous things going on as you have more and better resource generation abilities. The game is a sandbox, I am playing with the BBEG, but you are too small beans for him to really care about you.

In pursuit, you will find success or failure, if you succeed, you will be rewarded with the prior agreed reward -- ducats, vesper, fame, or other thing we will have negotiated ahead of time (e.g., an earned favor, a new quest lead, etc). This is roughly a 'Score' from Blades in the Dark.

More likely, you'll fail. Most things will take a few attempts, and goals persist between characters, so if you fail but escape the grasping clutches of the darkness and cling to life, you earn yourself a little bit of fame for the attempt, whatever loot you managed to escape with, and the chance to tell the tale.

If you die, however, you don't get to keep the loot, maybe your friends pick it up, maybe they have their own problems, either way, it's not yours (anymore). Your legend, however, lives on -- whatever you do, your accrued Fame all gets added to your order. You can then buy new traits, activate traits, and generate a new character. Activation Fame is added to the initial character fame, and every character starts with 15m of fame on top of that.

Then it's back in the loop.

It's worth distinguishing between character-level goals and order-level goals. Order goals are big long-term objectives, characters can generally pursue them in lots of ways. So while the Order may have some big, long-term plan; individual agents of that order probably don't pursue that directly (certainly not at low levels), 

Good Character Level Goals:

1. "I want to hunt a monster to bolster my reputation as a monster hunter"
	1. Corresponds to a Order Belief like: "Good monster hunters hunt big monsters", or interest like "Establishing our reputation as a Monster Hunting Society"
2. "I want to talk to the townsfolk about rumors related to the Tower"
	1. Corresponds to an Order goal like: "Defeat the MW", if that's your thing, or maybe for the MHS here, corresponds to an interest in preservation of hunting grounds, if people just plop wizard towers without properly considering the ecology...
3. "I want to find work by soliciting wealthy patrons for jobs.
	1. If your Order is looking to establish itself, patronage is a good goal that translates easily to a character, and between characters after a little while.

These all are working towards that larger goal, but are at a level a single character can reasonably achieve.

Bad Character Level Goals:

1. "I want to make 1000 ducats."
2. "I want to fight the BBEG"
3. "I want to level up"

These don't tie back to the broader order's goals, and thus make for poor goals. You can convert these to better goals by asking "Why would my Order send me to do this?" Instead of "I want to make 1000d" you have a goal like, "I want to get the materials needed to construct a Lodge for the MHS near Iskavi"
