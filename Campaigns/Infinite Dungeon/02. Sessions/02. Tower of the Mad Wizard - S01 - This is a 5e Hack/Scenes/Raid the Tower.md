Players Raid the Tower, they enter [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/Tower of the Mad Wizard/The Machineworks]] and can explore. In Intro Mode, the [[Infernal Machine]] does not happen, but the escape sequence does, but without loot or anything players run for the door, but they are all killed. Cut to a scene with [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]] collecting the players' things and setting them aside in a room _filled_ with similar stuff. He smirks and goes to greet some incoming customers (the players, again) giving the same spiel as started the thing, "You you... are you going to drink or just read?" Future encounters at the Machineworks will be in 'normal' mode, and include the final fight and full sequence.

Players can otherwise get to the [[Skybridge|Skybridge]], [[Loading Docks]], and [[Fuel Manifold Room]] and engage the 'intro' mode fights for those bosses/areas
