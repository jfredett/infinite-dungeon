  description: "Say:\n\n> **\"One of you sees it, one of you feels it. Do we roll for it, or do you decide amongst yourselves?\"**\n\n### The One Who Sees It:\n\n- The figure under the sheet begins to stir.\n- She mumbles in a language that’s **almost familiar**.\n- Abasi perks up and approaches. The Ushabti allows it.\n- Meanwhile, from the cracks in the wall, **plant tendrils** emerge — white buds, lavender-scented. They seem friendly, pleasant\n- They form an **tall archway**.\n\nIn an instant, the stone becomes a **heavy wooden door**, dark and banded with wood, no Iron. No handle.\n\nRoll dummy **2d3**, and describe two of the following:\n\n- The words **“Vault of Aten by way of Ynn”** written in silver ink.\n- A **bright, sunny garden** on the other side. \"Green grass and manicured garden lie beyond, it seems much nicer than this place.\"\n- **Two people**: one flying through the door, another small, beautiful, clearly non-human, smirking and waving as she **closes the door**.\n### The One Who Feels It:\n\n- They are standing directly in the path of the flying figure.\n- Roll a **DEX save** (1d4 damage on fail, knocked prone).\n- They see the other detail not chosen above.\n- Someone **lands on them** — this is **Dovid**.\n"
