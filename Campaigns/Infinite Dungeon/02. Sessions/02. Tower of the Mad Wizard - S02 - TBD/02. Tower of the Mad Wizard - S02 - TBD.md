- Plans:
	- Get them on the Springarden quest
	- Prep two 5RDs for the world, a cave encounter and a ruin site probably?
	- Firm up the hexcrawl rules
	- Aim to point them at [[Ynn]].
	- Depthcrawl Journal creation stuff
	- Cold open is Nik collecting the things from the previous adventurers, forgot to do that last time

The overarching aim is to get to the point on the 5e side where I can introduce the [["On Rotated Realities"|Rotated Realities]] concept, which will drive the system jumping.

I want to maintain a stock of 2-3 5RDs prepped so I have some options and am set up if they visit a couple sites. I can keep Heliana's available for monster hunting purposes. I need to solidify the Hexcrawl procedure and get any condition-stuff automated, which means I need to figure out how to store arbitrary data on the 5e sheet (or elsewhere, IDK)

Once I've got that stood up, then I can introduce the system-jumping mechanic. There'll be a post on the signboard that leads to another strangely-located doorway. When the PCs enter, they find themselves arriving on the far side transformed; creating new characters in the target system. The adventure hook will state the total reward for completing the adventure. These adventures add more Vesper/Ducats to the system (they aren't drawn from the main pool), so doing, e.g., the Dragonbane Starter adventure might net out 9L of Vesper and 5000d, regardless of how many people do it, then my total vesper in the system is ~24L and 20kd. Characters entering the world might be able to bring some money/items/stuff with them, and the characters they create stay 'local' to that world.

I'll have these be separate worlds in Foundry and I can have more than one on the same system later. e.g., this is the 'dragonbane' world at `db.infinite-dungeon.goml.games` and then a `5e.infinite-dungeon.goml.games`, etc. Later if I have multiple distinct worlds under the same system, then I can have them named underneath.

Plot-wise, the MWDDD is attempting to create his own Ynn or Stygian Library out of this reality by inducing a 'rotation' which he, ostensibly, will quiesce when he has achieved his goal; he has already succeeded in inducing the initial rotation, which has led to much of the (otherwise unintentional) chaos that created all the weird creatures invading the otherwise normal(ish) human world. As the rotation proceeds, the confusion and chaos gets worse, and other realities start to co-align with the main one, resulting in doorways to these other realities. The job of the adventurers is to:

1. Discover all this through lore and exploration
2. Investigate the various realities that start to coalign with our own as our reality precesses through others
3. Find a way to halt the rotation and return reality to some sense of stability

The MWDDD isn't so much an evil guy as just a guy with an agenda and no sense or concern for who his agenda will impact. He views most people as expendable resources.
