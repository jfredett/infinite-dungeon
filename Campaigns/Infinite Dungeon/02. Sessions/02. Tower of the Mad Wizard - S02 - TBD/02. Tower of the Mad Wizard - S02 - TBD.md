> The opening theme song plays and we see a "Previously on I N F I N I T E D U N G E O N"
>  
> It is bright and early, 8AM in front of the _Pleasantly Finite_. A band of the Sort arrive at the PF, it's getting towards the end of June, and the weather is  we see them from a distance, as if we're a bird resting on a tree near the PF. We see them set off to go to Matilda's, we see them set off to the strange doorway. It's been a few months now, it's June in Upper Carpathia. Not hot yet, but warm and breezy. You can almost smell the Hospitable Sea on the air, though it being a few hundred kilometers away, it's probably just your imagination.
> 
> We see another band of the sort arrive, much like the previous. The old warrant has had explicit directions to the so called "Machineworks." Many parties have adventured to it, few have returned, and none unchanged. The PF is bustling with adventurers, and work is plentiful. The potion rack is half empty, the smell of beer and tall tales overwhelms you.
> 
> Across from the PF a new building has sprouted up, only perhaps 3x5m, it houses a gruff looking man and his collection of weapons and traps. The man is clearly mundane, likely from the local village. He has a sign above the small shed: "WILL PAY FOR QUARRY, INQUIRE WITHIN". The sign is written in Greek, the common language of the Mundane.


Upon first hexcrawl move:

> Who are we to deny the word of Gygax?

> Travel involves timetracking, we will track time carefully. The current date is the 26th of June, 114CC ("Capathian Collective (Reckoning)"), the PF has been in service for about 2 years, the previous episode took place about 15 months prior, in April of 113CC. It is currently 8AM Local Time.
> 
> The Hexcrawl procedure I have laid out requires you nominate a _Scout_ to make rolls related to navigation rolls. Valid choices for making navigation rolls are any relevant skill, e.g., Nature, Survival, etc. Generally speaking the DCs will account for any tools or advantages you have; abnormal additional resources (e.g., a temporary assist from an NPC, benefits of a spell or potion, etc), may give you additional advantage on the roll.
> 
> The Party then determines a route, I recommend you have a cartographer keep track of the route you took, what you found there, etc. While we're in this Iskavi hex, we're going to be relatively safe from bad mapping; but it's not _safe_ here, there are things in the woods and hills, and you need to be careful of them.
>
> After you determine what your direction and pace are, I'll have your Scout make a navigation roll -- again, the roll accounts for all advantages of help, etc -- and then I'll do some math behind the scenes. Then there'll be a second roll made by your scout, you want to roll _low_ on that number. When you roll low enough, the hex will be explored, you all will recognize it, and I'll tell you _exactly_ where it is on the map. You can spend time in a hex _exploring_ to make further attempts to map the terrain. Explored terrain costs half to move through.
> 
> After you've travelled, explored, or rested in your current location, I'll tell you whether there are encounters, if the weather changes, the current date and time, etc. Then we loop and do it again. Unexplored terrain will not be revealed on the map; you'll have to maintain your own for that. Your token won't move until you enter explored terrain, at which point it will move there directly without revealing fog of war or anything.
> 
> When you've explored enough of this hex, I'll reveal the thing in full, and then we can start talking about moving in the overworld. This is going to take just a bit of time to automate and get working well, so I expect the procedure to be slow, and as we hone it, it will be more quick.
> 
> Last thing, generated threats are not balanced. You may run into encounters far above your station. Running away is always an option. Threats generated, however, are persistent and represent some chunk of the total Vesper/Ducats in the system. So until they are defeated, those resources are locked away. They obey all the same movement, provision, and exploration rules as you do, and they will develop their own agendas and interests over time. The only difference is that I calculate all that movement in the time between sessions.

- Hillfort encounter is an incursion of a new kind of creature (Goblins + 1 Hobgoblin) which took over an old Roman encampment in the hills. Opportunities to find some old SPQR stuff here.
	- Entrance is guarded by a squad of goblins, can be bypassed with stealth or distraction, but they attack non-goblins on sight. A secret entrance around the back where the wall has rotted.
	- Once inside, there are a few areas where the other goblins reside. These can be dispatched stealthily, attacked en masse, or tricked by inciting some kind of conflict between the various squads.
	- Upon defeating all the goblins in the encampment, as the party begins to loot, the leader returns with his expedition, finding the destruction and/or chaos, he attacks the party.
	- When the final enemies are defeated, the players loot the site, and find a number of SPQR artifacts and at least one copy of [[Burning Questions]].
- [[Windmill 5RD]] 

---

- Plans:
	- Get them on the Springarden quest
	- Prep two 5RDs for the world, a cave encounter and a ruin site probably?
	- Firm up the hexcrawl rules
	- Aim to point them at [[Ynn]].
	- Depthcrawl Journal creation stuff
	- Cold open is Nik collecting the things from the previous adventurers, forgot to do that last time

The overarching aim is to get to the point on the 5e side where I can introduce the [["On Rotated Realities"|Rotated Realities]] concept, which will drive the system jumping.

I want to maintain a stock of 2-3 5RDs prepped so I have some options and am set up if they visit a couple sites. I can keep Heliana's available for monster hunting purposes. I need to solidify the Hexcrawl procedure and get any condition-stuff automated, which means I need to figure out how to store arbitrary data on the 5e sheet (or elsewhere, IDK)

Once I've got that stood up, then I can introduce the system-jumping mechanic. There'll be a post on the signboard that leads to another strangely-located doorway. When the PCs enter, they find themselves arriving on the far side transformed; creating new characters in the target system. The adventure hook will state the total reward for completing the adventure. These adventures add more Vesper/Ducats to the system (they aren't drawn from the main pool), so doing, e.g., the Dragonbane Starter adventure might net out 9L of Vesper and 5000d, regardless of how many people do it, then my total vesper in the system is ~24L and 20kd. Characters entering the world might be able to bring some money/items/stuff with them, and the characters they create stay 'local' to that world.

I'll have these be separate worlds in Foundry and I can have more than one on the same system later. e.g., this is the 'dragonbane' world at `db.infinite-dungeon.goml.games` and then a `5e.infinite-dungeon.goml.games`, etc. Later if I have multiple distinct worlds under the same system, then I can have them named underneath.

Plot-wise, the MWDDD is attempting to create his own Ynn or Stygian Library out of this reality by inducing a 'rotation' which he, ostensibly, will quiesce when he has achieved his goal; he has already succeeded in inducing the initial rotation, which has led to much of the (otherwise unintentional) chaos that created all the weird creatures invading the otherwise normal(ish) human world. As the rotation proceeds, the confusion and chaos gets worse, and other realities start to co-align with the main one, resulting in doorways to these other realities. The job of the adventurers is to:

1. Discover all this through lore and exploration
2. Investigate the various realities that start to coalign with our own as our reality precesses through others
3. Find a way to halt the rotation and return reality to some sense of stability

The MWDDD isn't so much an evil guy as just a guy with an agenda and no sense or concern for who his agenda will impact. He views most people as expendable resources.
