[[Mithrandir]] has left a warrant rewarding the first party to be able to find a way to enter the mysterious [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/The Tower of the Mad Wizard|Tower]] that sprung up in [[Upper Carpathia]], a number of strange buildings and structures have been appearing, but this tower was the first and largest.

This warrant has already been fulfilled by the time the player's see it at the
[[Pleasantly Finite]], where they all begin their adventure. [[Nikolai Ivanovich
Lobachevsky|Nik]], the proprietor, explains to them how to get to the entrance,
which was luckily really close to his in, but only recently discovered. He's
expecting a lot of new business and so moved out of the small hamlet he used to
live in a few miles away and built this place to capitalize on the wave of
adventurers coming through.



A few years ago, just outside Odesa, a massive tower rose seemingly overnight.
Stretching hundreds of meters into the sky, at the top shines an eery, unnatural
light into the darkness.

The tower initially had no visible entrance, and was assumed to be some sort of
extraplanar entity. For months, no one knew how to enter, but the strange sight
attracted scholar's, intellectuals, adventurers, and entrepreneurs to the site.
Including on [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], or Nik for short. Nik is the
proprietor of [[The Pleasantly Finite]] Tavern and Inn; one of the more popular
of the many entrepreneurial encampments near the tower, and definitely the closest.

Recently, a strange man, tall, gray robed, old but wise, has been searching around the tower and enlisting adventurers.
You haven't run into him yet, but he has left the following sign at the PF:

![[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/10. Objects/MIthrandir's Warrant|MIthrandir's Warrant]]

Nik interrupts the party as they read, "You, you, you want drink or just read? Notice is old -- come inside and spend
money." He ushers them inside, the tavern smells like fresh timer and beer. A local band is playing in the corner, there
is some bustle, mostly adventurers. It is a little too warm, but the room is lively and there is a breeze coming
through. You can smell the spring of trees and flowers outside.

Nik is there to answer questions, he mentions at least:

1. The Vesper/Ducat/Renown system.
2. That the notice is old, a way to enter the Tower is just up the road, Nik really lucked out on the placement. The PF
    was struggling before. The Counterparty found it and are a little bit lauded, but Nik lucked out because he happened
    to be one of the closest entrepreneurial innkeeps that has set up shop here recently.
3. Mention Matilda, who knows more about how the tower entrance works. Nik just knows how to get there, but doesn't have
    any intention of going himself.
4. Nik offers free room and board to the players, on the condition that he gets to keep their stuff if they don't come
    back. He shows a contract that allows for a next of kin to claim half of the value in gold and vesper so long as
    they show up within 30 calendar days. Nik complains that the damn government made him add that clause, Nik does not
    like the government.

Players can generally:

1. Go to a Raid in the Tower
    - First session is the Infernal Machine raid, in intro mode, maybe even in Black Knight mode (major permanent injury
      replacing death on failed death save)
2. Seek out more information from Matilda about the tower.
    - Tips the players to the Garden of Ynn
3. Ask Nik about something
    - See below for details, Nik is most likely who they will ask general setting questions
4. Explore other known areas for random encounters, local quests, etc. These offer no Fame, but do pay Gold and Vesper
    - Slot in a monster hunting module, or a simple hex crawl

If the players don't attempt the tower in a session, roll d20 + number of missed attempts. DC30, no natural 20s. If at
any point you pass, the reward from the raid is halved, the count reset, and the clock restarted. The first time this
happens, the party is informed that the so-called 'Counterparty' claims to have defeated the encounter and brought back
some various machinery and such from the tower as 'proof'. The machinery is genuine, but the claims are not, they stole
this from the entry area, and this is obvious when the players actually go to the Raid; as the pipes are made of iron,
and not copper as they are further in.
