Players now have access to [[Upper Carpathia]]

The goal is to get to Odesa, but getting there will involve a bunch of hexcrawling and probably some side errands and more monster hunting

Goal is to change things up by pointing to the Stygian Library and a broader hexcrawl. Add a couple monster hunts nearer Odesa, goal is to get them to the Stygian Library in Odesa, maybe incorporate some pointcrawl in the city? Players should get pointed to [[Old Repo/lore/locations/Hilbert's Hotel|Hilbert's Hotel]] as well
