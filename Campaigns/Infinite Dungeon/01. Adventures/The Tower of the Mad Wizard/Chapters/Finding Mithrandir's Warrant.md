Strange things have been happening around [[Odesa]].

A massive tower sprung out of the ground, overnight almost.

[[Mithrandir|A strange, old man]] has left a warrant rewarding the first party to be able to find a way to enter the mysterious [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/05. Locations/The Tower of the Mad Wizard|Tower]] that sprung up in [[Upper Carpathia]], a number of strange buildings and structures have been appearing, but this tower was the first and largest.

This warrant has already been fulfilled by the time the player's see it at the [[Pleasantly Finite]], where they all begin their adventure. [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nik]], the proprietor, explains to them how to get to the entrance, which was luckily really close to his in, but only recently discovered. He's expecting a lot of new business and so moved out of the small hamlet he used to live in a few miles away and built this place to capitalize on the wave of adventurers coming through.

The tower initially had no visible entrance, and was assumed to be some sort of extraplanar entity. For months, no one knew how to enter, but the strange sight attracted scholar's, intellectuals, adventurers, and entrepreneurs to the site. Including on [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], or Nik for short. Nik is the proprietor of [[The Pleasantly Finite]] Tavern and Inn; one of the more popular of the many entrepreneurial encampments near the tower, and definitely the closest.

This introductory chapter should be about getting the players to hexcrawl to the tower, having a small random encounter with bears or w/e along the way. They do the intro raid, die, and get their Fame bonuses.

## Restrictions

- Players cannot leave the Iskavi subhex.
