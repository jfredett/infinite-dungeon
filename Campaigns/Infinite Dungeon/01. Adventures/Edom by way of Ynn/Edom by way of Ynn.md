The adventurers arrive in the Ancient City of [[Edom]] as an outcome of a Ynn depthcrawl. In here is a bit of palace intrigue pointcrawling to do with some brawling, some sleuthing, some doing of whatever the Bard wants to do, etc. This might be a good way to get [[Mithrandir]] and original copy of the text he references in [["On the Viral Idea"]] 


I think it's structured like a couple 5-room dungeons as a pointcrawl. Something like:

0. Players get sent by [[Mithrandir]] through Ynn looking for "[[Parmadil]]". Or, if they find their way into Ynn some other way, they may stumble upon him.
1.  "[[Parmadil]]" (or just Parmadil if the players don't know it's a psuedonym, which Mithrandir will tell them) tells the players he is from [[Edom]], and needs to get back home, he does not know how to get out. If the players instruct him on how to leave the garden (assuming they know, which Mithrandir will teach them). If a player writes the exit word, it will take them to an otherwise deserted region in what would be Syria, on the coast. Parmadil will have a panic attack and retreat back to Ynn and run away if the players do not stop him. If he is able to write the phrase, then they will be taken to Edom in _Parmadil's Timeline_, which is c425BCE.
2. Here Parmadil has revealed his real name, and the players learn of the strange disease he has been treating, as well as some papers he's been translating about them. He mentions [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir|Athul re'Athir]], an Edomic Magus who worked in the court of a rival faction. Parmadil has other works of his he deemed unrelated to his problem, he is willing to let a player make copies of them, but he needs help solving the mystery that is affecting his patients.
3. Parmadil then directs the players to pointcrawl around and do some 5-room-sessions, maybe one is sneaking into the rival's place and avoiding/confronting Athul, which might bring unwanted attention to the players; another might be resolving a conflict between two other houses, and then once those are done a final one might be getting back to Parmadil before an agent of his rival faction can come and kill his patients and destroy his work.
	1. If the players fail to prevent the destruction, Parmadil lets them _take_ the books; when they get back, Mithrandir _freaks out_ and -- after magically copying them -- sends them to the [[Stygian Library]] to place the book, and warns that they will have to find a way out, as entrance is one way when returning overdue books to the Stygian Library. He wishes the players luck, and forces them to go immediately, so as "Not to upset his cherished friend in charge of Time, [[The Swiss]]"
	2. If they succeed, then Parmadil, having realized that they are not from his timeline, helps copy the manuscripts and gives the players as much information as he can, both about the Idea and the other writings by MWDDD.

Players attempting to use magic to translate anything by MWDDD find that it does not work and in fact violently resists, inflicting 1, then 1d4, then 1d6, etc for each repeated attempt. MWDDD has his own [[Private Language of the Mad Wizard Dracul Dracthulu Dracthir|Private Language]] which is magically resilient.

I think this would be a lower lethality section, more story driven, so probably not too many big fights. If the players do manage to TPK, I think this just resets due to 'time bullshit' and maybe we skip over some of the introductory stuff, players can do the Groundhog Day thing.


I think the pointcrawl would be something like:
