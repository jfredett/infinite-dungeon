Target level range 4-6, 5 PCs. 3-6 sessions. Gently Repeatable with Time Bullshit

This is some time travel bullshit, so if the players fail at various points, they can observe the consequences and potentially _try again_ if they can find a way to go back in time and send new adventurers. If this happens, Matilda tells them they need to talk to the big G himself, [[Mithrandir]] about it. He will facilitate the process of going back, but warns that the goal must be to rescue all the people who are out of place. Later, when the players discover a method to fight the IoT, they can come back again and cure the IoT in Rasha instead of Parmadil (his treatment idea doesn't work, the notes he found aren't sufficient)

Matilda should send them after her friend, who is Parmadil's patient. If they manage to save them, then Matilda's friend is a new NPC for the Iskavi Hex, maybe a Druid or something -- or the Traveling Seamstress? She tells them this as she is working on weeding out some invasive species from her garden, which she mentions is called [[The Idea of Thorns#Variant - Tenecel Parmadileus|T. Parmadileus]], or more commonly known as 'Bitter Edomvine' which grows near Old Edom in the far south of Greater Arcadia. She's surprised to see it up this far, usually the winters on the Hospitable Sea are sufficient to curtail it's advance.

Matilda is worried about her friend, who went to explore somewhere called "Ynn", she will be cagey about this with the PCs until they have a level or two amongst them.

Once they get into Ynn, they don't find her friend, they find Parmadil. Parmadil found Matilda's friend, brought them back to his home, and then came back into Ynn at their instruction to look for information on how to cure her. Parmadil found some information, but was ambushed by an unknown force (in fact, it was Athul, who followed Parmadil into the Garden). Athul is a Magus for the house of Athir, and Parmadil is a Magus for the Zanzir. There are seven total houses in Edom, 6 and the house of the grand duke. Parmadil, upon return, discovers that Athul has the various journals and documents he found in Ynn. He needs those in order to attempt to cure Matilda's friend. He also needs the aid of another magus of another house to assist him, he only trusts his colleague from the house Arulen, Rethri 'al-Ruhs' re'Arulen. Rethri is reluctant because her house is in the midst of a public spat with the house of Arulen with that of Zanzir, and her assisting would result in a public capitulation which her house can't afford. She doesn't have an issue helping personally, but politics are in the way.

Athir has private quarters in the relevant district of Edom, a little fenced house in a posh district of the city on the waterfront. He is the only resident of the house, but he has enchanted it heavily and has summoned guards and guardians. There are lots of traps. Additionally, there is a chance he is stalking the halls.

At this stage of his career, Athir is roughly a 8th level Abjuration Wizard. He appears to be in his early to mid forties. The notes and books he stole from Parmadil are located in his inner chamber, along with some writings in a mix of Edomic and another language that (on a failed intelligence save) harms the reader with psychic damage. He has legendary actions and lair actions, and can't be killed, but might be driven to retreat by a sufficiently well coordinated or overpowered party.

- Entry: Guarded by two massive stone statues which have ~4 actions per combat. Bypass or Fight. Deadly fight for 5L5s.
- If Fight
	- Athul is alerted to the presence of intruders, and begins to marshall his forces for a fight.
	- If Athul assesses the threat to be significant, he will call for the _authorities_ as well.
	- If players beat Athul, he will retreat and start a 1 hour clock, after which the authorities arrive. This is a real-time/game-time clock. If a significant event occurs that will take real time to resolve, reduce the clock, also reduce it in real time. When it hits zero, a force of city magi and guard arrive to arrest the players.
- If Bypass
	- The guards can be bypassed by creating a distraction, sneaking, and so on. They are there to prevent riff-raff, like a deadbolt on a door, it's not undefeatable, but it keeps most people out.
- Either way, PCs gain access to the next area, the entry courtyard.
	- At it's center, a pool with a large Wisteria tree dripping pink flowers into the water below, there are small red and yellow fish swimming in the pond. You hear a gentle singing coming from beneath the wisteria branches.
	- If the party lags, the true guardian, a Wisteria Siren, will capture the players with her song, compelling them to walk into the water where they drown or she eats them.
	- If the party fights here, no one notices; Athul doesn't like watching her, she doesn't like being watched.
	- If the party moves on, they must pass charisma checks or be compelled, the Siren will give some chase through the next area
- The Maze
	- Athul's chambers have an internal depth crawl maze that has lots of small encounters and frequent party separations. The Siren, if undefeated, also chases them through the Maze.
	- Also an opportunity to pick up other adventurers if they died.
	- Also a place to hide from the fuzz if the fight option was taken.
	- After getting to the top level depth, the players escape, potentially one by one, to the final place.
- Athul's chambers
	- Start a clock, players have 10 rolls amongst them, there are some lore items for Athul here, in particular, there are untranslated journals, and also the notes that Parmadil needs. They can also find implicating evidence that will resolve the issue with Rethri, though this can be found through other means. There are valuables here, including magically crystallized vesper that can be reconstituted into pure vesper. This shouldn't be possible, no one else has ever done this as far as you or any wizard you know knows.
	- After the rolls are expended, Athul shows up with support. Players can try to run back through the maze, or they can continue forward out the balcony where they can either fight Athul, or jump off into the water below and try to swim away with their loot. The jump is about 100', survivable, but definitely dangerous. There is also another way to scramble down, but Athul could give chase in that situation.
- Once away, players may be able to resolve the whole thing, or they need to proceed to Rethri's quest.

![[Edom, By Way of Ynn - Plot Structure]]

House Arulen and House Zanzir are in a petty squabble over a recent change in city government. In an unusual move, the Grand Duke, traditionally a purely ceremonial role, exercised one of her Ancient and Unquestionable Authories to alter the lines of the Duchy, forcing Arulen to cede the valuable Harborside district, to Zanzir, for the considerably less valuable economically, but extremely valuable to the Zanzir in a cultural sense, Sanctuary district. No one likes this plan. It is insane that this would happen, no one has used this power in years because it's a surefire way to start a war between houses that will inevitably result in the murder of the Grand Duke, which is traditionally the first thing that happens in a war between houses, as the succession of a Grand Duke requires an immediate cessation of all hostilities. Any time a War breaks out in Edom, someone just kills the Grand Duke, and there is no longer a war in Edom.

It's not a good system, but it's not the worst system either.

The reason for this insanity is that Athul has been experimenting on the grand duke with mind control magic (more stuff in his chambers about this). No one wants to kill the Duke, because it would mean the re-entry of the House Turin into the political landscape, and likely mean the ascension of either Zanzir or Arulen, effectively ending a century-old alliance between the two houses that has kept politics stable for everyone, and greatly enriched the Grand Duke and, consequently, his house Turin.

There are at least the following ways of ending the spat:

1. Find incriminating evidence of Athul's manipulation
2. Frame another house for manipulation with manufactured evidence
3. Break the spell on the Grand Duke

#1 involves retrieving the info from Athul's inner study, #2 involves fabricating, planting, then causing to be discovered evidence that some other house is acting to cause this/influence the GD. #3 involves infiltrating the capitol district, breaking into/gaining entry to the GD's apartments, and then discovering and destroying the totems that Athul has placed.

Upon #1's completion, Athul is driven from the city, exiled never to return. Parmadil gives the players access to the books for copying, and teaches them a magical copying spell, but has worked out they're from another timeline, and so disallows them from bringing that actual materials back with them, so as not to upset his friend, who he calls [[The Swiss|'re'Suis']]. The treatment still fails as in #2.

Upon #2's completion, a war breaks out amongst the houses, and so someone kills the GD. al-Ruhs and Parmadil work together to attempt the cure, but fail, the disease progresses rapidly, and Parmadil sends the players off with all the notes and books and stuff they've found. Upon return, Matilda tells them to contact Mithrandir, and Mithrandir freaks out at the books being pulled 'out of time', and that [[The Swiss]] will be greatly upset by this, so they'll need to travel to the [[Odesa Public Library]] to return the books; they should ask the librarian there for access to the section on "Oceanids", where they will find access to [[Stygian Library]], where they can return the books. He sends them simply to retrieve another book from the library to help him translate the language in the books that they have come back with; whether copies or otherwise, he suggests storing all the books in the library so that they will be accessible in the future.

Upon #3's completion, the GD implicates Athul, and the plot progresses as in #1.

Later, the players can return to this timeline with the _actual_ cure for this variant of the [[The Idea of Thorns#Variant - Tenecel Parmadileus|idea of thorns]], and cure Rasha for real. This obviates the need for any of the other questing, and 'cures' Edom in both the current timeline _and the current timeline_, unlocking the 'modern' (c. 112CE) version of 'Old Edom', which is now a modern, Duskvol-esque city in Syria/Palestine.

Entering Ynn for the first time:

> You're... somewhere lovely. There is a bright blue sky above you, crayon clouds and cobalt blue, the air is the perfect temperature, the humidity is just right -- whatever you prefer, that's how it feels. It's uncanny, the sun is shining but you never quite get it in your eyes. A gentle, even illumination covers everything, the ground glows with saturated color -- almost technicolor. You have shadow, but it's always just a little behind and to whichever side you go looking for it, exaggerating all your gestures just enough to be pleasantly silly to onlooking children. You feel an inexorable urge to sing a tune in a major key. The ground is grassy and mossy and green, the trees are electric, like after a spring rain, there are neat hedges and hydrangeas, azaleas and lilacs and daffodils and lilies and roses -- so many roses. Sand cherry, crab apples, cherry trees, dogwoods, plum, willow, and in the distance you swear you see chestnut trees and elms and ash. This places seems endless, and the horizon is many many miles further away than what you're used too. It almost feels like the world is wrapping back in on itself. There are no pestering insects, the air is sweet smelling and clears the sinuses. It smells slightly like rain, even though it's dry. Every flower is always blooming, you're certain of it.
>
> There are so many paths leading away from here, every one of you sees a path towards a part of this place that looks more like the favorite spot you had outdoors when you were a kid. The door you entered by clicks shut behind you, it's gone before you can turn to see it, as if it was never there. There is no wall here where you could've drawn it even if you wanted to, I suppose you'll have to go looking for an exit. 


----

I have a rough version of a bit of art I'm going to have for the [[The Idea of Thorns]], in particular, I'm going to take the phrase:

> Lanatar tenecel ynnir

Which is Quenya for:

> Lit "Is (present, negation) Thorn-Idea Ynn's-bane."

or

> Tr: "This is not the Idea of Thorns"

on like, a sketch of a rose or something. I've written the phrase in Old Syriac script, which is gently Tengwar-y (well, I suppose Tengwar is gently Aramaic-adjacent), but should make for a cool puzzle if anyone bothers to dig, and a cool thing otherwise. I don't know that I'm technically using it correctly (AFAIK it should have, e.g., vowel marks under everything? I only add them when the vowel changes), but it looks cool, just needs a few more iterations.

---

I also want to have a proper 'thorn-idea' set of art where the line is just "_lana tenecel ynnir_" (lit: "is (present) thorn-idea ynn-bane", tr: "This _is_ The Idea of Thorns.")
