The adventurers arrive in the Ancient City of [[Edom]] as an outcome of a Ynn depthcrawl. In here is a bit of palace intrigue pointcrawling to do with some brawling, some sleuthing, some doing of whatever the Bard wants to do, etc. This might be a good way to get [[Mithrandir]] and original copy of the text he references in [["On the Viral Idea"]] 


I think it's structured like a couple 5-room dungeons as a pointcrawl. Something like:

0. Players get sent by [[Mithrandir]] through Ynn looking for "[[Parmadil]]". Or, if they find their way into Ynn some other way, they may stumble upon him.
1.  "[[Parmadil]]" (or just Parmadil if the players don't know it's a psuedonym, which Mithrandir will tell them) tells the players he is from [[Edom]], and needs to get back home, he does not know how to get out. If the players instruct him on how to leave the garden (assuming they know, which Mithrandir will teach them). If a player writes the exit word, it will take them to an otherwise deserted region in what would be Syria, on the coast. Parmadil will have a panic attack and retreat back to Ynn and run away if the players do not stop him. If he is able to write the phrase, then they will be taken to Edom in _Parmadil's Timeline_, which is c425BCE.
2. Here Parmadil has revealed his real name, and the players learn of the strange disease he has been treating, as well as some papers he's been translating about them. He mentions [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir|Athul re'Athir]], an Edomic Magus who worked in the court of a rival faction. Parmadil has other works of his he deemed unrelated to his problem, he is willing to let a player make copies of them, but he needs help solving the mystery that is affecting his patients.
3. Parmadil then directs the players to pointcrawl around and do some 5-room-sessions, maybe one is sneaking into the rival's place and avoiding/confronting Athul, which might bring unwanted attention to the players; another might be resolving a conflict between two other houses, and then once those are done a final one might be getting back to Parmadil before an agent of his rival faction can come and kill his patients and destroy his work.
	1. If the players fail to prevent the destruction, Parmadil lets them _take_ the books; when they get back, Mithrandir _freaks out_ and -- after magically copying them -- sends them to the [[Stygian Library]] to place the book, and warns that they will have to find a way out, as entrance is one way when returning overdue books to the Stygian Library. He wishes the players luck, and forces them to go immediately, so as "Not to upset his cherished friend in charge of Time, [[The Swiss]]"
	2. If they succeed, then Parmadil, having realized that they are not from his timeline, helps copy the manuscripts and gives the players as much information as he can, both about the Idea and the other writings by MWDDD.

Players attempting to use magic to translate anything by MWDDD find that it does not work and in fact violently resists, inflicting 1, then 1d4, then 1d6, etc for each repeated attempt. MWDDD has his own [[Private Language of the Mad Wizard Dracul Dracthulu Dracthir|Private Language]] which is magically resilient.

I think this would be a lower lethality section, more story driven, so probably not too many big fights. If the players do manage to TPK, I think this just resets due to 'time bullshit' and maybe we skip over some of the introductory stuff, players can do the Groundhog Day thing.


I think the pointcrawl would be something like:

There are seven houses in edom, Parmadil (of house P) needs House A and B to come to an agreement about X, He needs C and D to deal with Y, and he needs something else only house R, his house's rival house and current employer of an earlier incarnation of the BBEG. The remaining house is the current Grand Duke (G), who is basically ceremonially removed from power by election, a way of checking houses that gain too much prestige -- make them grand duke and their role is so swept with ceremonial duties that they essentially get locked out of politics for the duration of the term, systematically culling the strongest member's influence (in theory)

A and B have MacGuffins M1, M2, M3
C and D have MacGuffins M2, M3, M4
R and P have MacGuffins M1, M4
G has all of them, in a room, begging to be stolen. G is virtually impossible to get an audience with, but intrepid and insistent players might try to weasel/social engineer something. If they come up with a clever way then reward them greatly. The MacGuffins themselves are Fame items worth 15m of fame each, or 120m for an intact set of 4. Nik knows a guy.

Each pair starts with a random one from it's pool, then when the players meet the first one, roll to see if they already have the other in their possession. If they do, they'll generally not be willing to part with it and the opposing house will approach them suggesting they work together to steal both, and split them 50/50. If they don't, they'll suggest that if you steal the other, they'll give you one, they just need the other's.

For C and D, the players enter the situation above but in media res, when going to meet whichever, they find it on fire, and the other house has a crew on site looting the macguffins. Now they are placed in the position of either helping whichever side, or just stealing it before the other side can.

R will know that _a_ party is working with P, because of spies in P, but won't know who they are necessarily. So theft/social engineering is the only real option there. Athul is still a very powerful enemy and will happily TPK some parties. However he is not omnipresent, nor omniscient, and so sneaky or clever players may be able to get to get at the ones they have.

P needs any three, and only to borrow. He assumes the party will return them, but no one knows that he's using them and he is too busy with patients to care what happens after he uses them to help his patient.

Entering Ynn for the first time:

> You're... somewhere lovely. There is a bright blue sky above you, crayon clouds and cobalt blue, the air is the perfect temperature, the humidity is just right -- whatever you prefer, that's how it feels. It's uncanny, the sun is shining but you never quite get it in your eyes. A gentle, even illumination covers everything, the ground glows with saturated color -- almost technicolor. You have shadow, but it's always just a little behind and to whichever side you go looking for it, exaggerating all your gestures just enough to be pleasantly silly to onlooking children. You feel an inexorable urge to sing a tune in a major key. The ground is grassy and mossy and green, the trees are electric, like after a spring rain, there are neat hedges and hydrangeas, azaleas and lilacs and daffodils and lilies and roses -- so many roses. Sand cherry, crab apples, cherry trees, dogwoods, plum, willow, and in the distance you swear you see chestnut trees and elms and ash. This places seems endless, and the horizon is many many miles further away than what you're used too. It almost feels like the world is wrapping back in on itself. There are no pestering insects, the air is sweet smelling and clears the sinuses. It smells slightly like rain, even though it's dry. Every flower is always blooming, you're certain of it.
>
> There are so many paths leading away from here, every one of you sees a path towards a part of this place that looks more like the favorite spot you had outdoors when you were a kid. The door you entered by clicks shut behind you, it's gone before you can turn to see it, as if it was never there. There is no wall here where you could've drawn it even if you wanted to, I suppose you'll have to go looking for an exit.

I have a rough version of a bit of art I'm going to have for the [[The Idea of Thorns]], in particular, I'm going to take the phrase:

> Lanatar tenecel ynnir

Which is Quenya for:

> Lit "Is (present, negation) Thorn-Idea Ynn's-bane."

or

> Tr: "This is not the Idea of Thorns"

on like, a sketch of a rose or something. I've written the phrase in Old Syriac script, which is gently Tengwar-y (well, I suppose Tengwar is gently Aramaic-adjacent), but should make for a cool puzzle if anyone bothers to dig, and a cool thing otherwise. I don't know that I'm technically using it correctly (AFAIK it should have, e.g., vowel marks under everything? I only add them when the vowel changes), but it looks cool, just needs a few more iterations.

---

I also want to have a proper 'thorn-idea' set of art where the line is just "_lana tenecel ynnir_" (lit: "is (present) thorn-idea ynn-bane", tr: "This _is_ The Idea of Thorns.")
