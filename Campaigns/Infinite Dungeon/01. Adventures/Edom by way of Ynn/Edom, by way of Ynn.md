Target level range 4-6, 5 PCs.

This is some time travel bullshit, so if the players fail at various points, they can observe the consequences and potentially _try again_ if they can find a way to go back in time and send new adventurers. If this happens, Matilda tells them they need to talk to the big G himself, [[Mithrandir]] about it. He will facilitate the process of going back, but warns that the goal must be to rescue all the people who are out of place. Later, when the players discover a method to fight the IoT, they can come back again and cure the IoT in Rasha instead of Parmadil (his treatment idea doesn't work, the notes he found aren't sufficient)

Matilda should send them after her friend, who is Parmadil's patient. If they manage to save them, then Matilda's friend is a new NPC for the Iskavi Hex, maybe a Druid or something -- or the Traveling Seamstress?

Matilda is worried about her friend, who went to explore somewhere called "Ynn", she will be cagey about this with the PCs until they have a level or two amongst them.

Once they get into Ynn, they don't find her friend, they find Parmadil. Parmadil found Matilda's friend, brought them back to his home, and then came back into Ynn at their instruction to look for information on how to cure her. Parmadil found some information, but was ambushed by an unknown force (in fact, it was Athul, who followed Parmadil into the Garden). Athul is a Magus for the house of Athir, and Parmadil is a Magus for the Zanzir. There are seven total houses in Edom, 6 and the house of the grand duke. Parmadil, upon return, discovers that Athul has the various journals and documents he found in Ynn. He needs those in order to attempt to cure Matilda's friend. He also needs the aid of another magus of another house to assist him, he only trusts his colleague from the house Arulen, Rethri 'al-Ruhs' re'Arulen. Rethri is reluctant because her house is in the midst of a public spat with the house of Arulen with that of Zanzir, and her assisting would result in a public capitulation which her house can't afford. She doesn't have an issue helping personally, but politics are in the way.

Athir has private quarters in the relevant district of Edom, a little fenced house in a posh district of the city on the waterfront. He is the only resident of the house, but he has enchanted it heavily and has summoned guards and guardians. There are lots of traps. Additionally, there is a chance he is stalking the halls.

At this stage of his career, Athir is roughly a 8th level Abjuration Wizard. He appears to be in his early to mid forties. The notes and books he stole from Parmadil are located in his inner chamber, along with some writings in a mix of Edomic and another language that (on a failed intelligence save) harms the reader with psychic damage. He has legendary actions and lair actions, and can't be killed, but might be driven to retreat by a sufficiently well coordinated or overpowered party.

- Entry: Guarded by two massive stone statues which have ~4 actions per combat. Bypass or Fight. Deadly fight for 5L5s.
- If Fight
	- Athul is alerted to the presence of intruders, and begins to marshall his forces for a fight.
	- If Athul assesses the threat to be significant, he will call for the _authorities_ as well.
	- If players beat Athul, he will retreat and start a 1 hour clock, after which the authorities arrive. This is a real-time/game-time clock. If a significant event occurs that will take real time to resolve, reduce the clock, also reduce it in real time. When it hits zero, a force of city magi and guard arrive to arrest the players.
- If Bypass
	- The guards can be bypassed by creating a distraction, sneaking, and so on. They are there to prevent riff-raff, like a deadbolt on a door, it's not undefeatable, but it keeps most people out.
- Either way, PCs gain access to the next area, the entry courtyard.
	- At it's center, a pool with a large Wisteria tree dripping pink flowers into the water below, there are small red and yellow fish swimming in the pond. You hear a gentle singing coming from beneath the wisteria branches.
	- If the party lags, the true guardian, a Wisteria Siren, will capture the players with her song, compelling them to walk into the water where they drown or she eats them.
	- If the party fights here, no one notices; Athul doesn't like watching her, she doesn't like being watched.
	- If the party moves on, they must pass charisma checks or be compelled, the Siren will give some chase through the next area
- The Maze
	- Athul's chambers have an internal depth crawl maze that has lots of small encounters and frequent party separations. The Siren, if undefeated, also chases them through the Maze.
	- Also an opportunity to pick up other adventurers if they died.
	- Also a place to hide from the fuzz if the fight option was taken.
	- After getting to the top level depth, the players escape, potentially one by one, to the final place.
- Athul's chambers
	- Start a clock, players have 10 rolls amongst them, there are some lore items for Athul here, in particular, there are untranslated journals, and also the notes that Parmadil needs. They can also find implicating evidence that will resolve the issue with Rethri, though this can be found through other means. There are valuables here, including magically crystallized vesper that can be reconstituted into pure vesper. This shouldn't be possible, no one else has ever done this as far as you or any wizard you know knows.
	- After the rolls are expended, Athul shows up with support. Players can try to run back through the maze, or they can continue forward out the balcony where they can either fight Athul, or jump off into the water below and try to swim away with their loot. The jump is about 100', survivable, but definitely dangerous. There is also another way to scramble down, but Athul could give chase in that situation.
- Once away, players may be able to resolve the whole thing, or they need to proceed to Rethri's quest.

The adventurers arrive in the Ancient City of [[Edom]] as an outcome of a Ynn depthcrawl. In here is a bit of palace intrigue pointcrawling to do with some brawling, some sleuthing, some doing of whatever the Bard wants to do, etc. This might be a good way to get [[Mithrandir]] and original copy of the text he references in [["On the Viral Idea"]] 


I think it's structured like a couple 5-room dungeons as a pointcrawl. Something like:

0. Players get sent by [[Mithrandir]] through Ynn looking for "[[Parmadil]]". Or, if they find their way into Ynn some other way, they may stumble upon him.
1.  "[[Parmadil]]" (or just Parmadil if the players don't know it's a psuedonym, which Mithrandir will tell them) tells the players he is from [[Edom]], and needs to get back home, he does not know how to get out. If the players instruct him on how to leave the garden (assuming they know, which Mithrandir will teach them). If a player writes the exit word, it will take them to an otherwise deserted region in what would be Syria, on the coast. Parmadil will have a panic attack and retreat back to Ynn and run away if the players do not stop him. If he is able to write the phrase, then they will be taken to Edom in _Parmadil's Timeline_, as in the [[00. The Time Matrix]].
2. Here Parmadil has revealed his real name, and the players learn of the strange disease he has been treating, as well as some papers he's been translating about them. He mentions [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir|Athul re'Athir]], an Edomic Magus who worked in the court of a rival faction. Parmadil has other works of his he deemed unrelated to his problem, he is willing to let a player make copies of them, but he needs help solving the mystery that is affecting his patients.
3. Parmadil then directs the players to pointcrawl around and do some 5-room-sessions, maybe one is sneaking into the rival's place and avoiding/confronting Athul, which might bring unwanted attention to the players; another might be resolving a conflict between two other houses, and then once those are done a final one might be getting back to Parmadil before an agent of his rival faction can come and kill his patients and destroy his work.
	1. If the players fail to prevent the destruction, Parmadil lets them _take_ the books; when they get back, Mithrandir _freaks out_ and -- after magically copying them -- sends them to the [[Stygian Library]] to place the book, and warns that they will have to find a way out, as entrance is one way when returning overdue books to the Stygian Library. He wishes the players luck, and forces them to go immediately, so as "Not to upset his cherished friend in charge of Time, [[The Swiss]]"
	2. If they succeed, then Parmadil, having realized that they are not from his timeline, helps copy the manuscripts and gives the players as much information as he can, both about the Idea and the other writings by MWDDD.

Players attempting to use magic to translate anything by MWDDD find that it does not work and in fact violently resists, inflicting 1, then 1d4, then 1d6, etc for each repeated attempt. MWDDD has his own [[Private Language of the Mad Wizard Dracul Dracthulu Dracthir|Private Language]] which is magically resilient.

Entering Ynn for the first time:

> You're... somewhere lovely. There is a bright blue sky above you, crayon clouds and cobalt blue, the air is the perfect temperature, the humidity is just right -- whatever you prefer, that's how it feels. It's uncanny, the sun is shining but you never quite get it in your eyes. A gentle, even illumination covers everything, the ground glows with saturated color -- almost technicolor. You have shadow, but it's always just a little behind and to whichever side you go looking for it, exaggerating all your gestures just enough to be pleasantly silly to onlooking children. You feel an inexorable urge to sing a tune in a major key. The ground is grassy and mossy and green, the trees are electric, like after a spring rain, there are neat hedges and hydrangeas, azaleas and lilacs and daffodils and lilies and roses -- so many roses. Sand cherry, crab apples, cherry trees, dogwoods, plum, willow, and in the distance you swear you see chestnut trees and elms and ash. This places seems endless, and the horizon is many many miles further away than what you're used too. It almost feels like the world is wrapping back in on itself. There are no pestering insects, the air is sweet smelling and clears the sinuses. It smells slightly like rain, even though it's dry. Every flower is always blooming, you're certain of it.
>
> There are so many paths leading away from here, every one of you sees a path towards a part of this place that looks more like the favorite spot you had outdoors when you were a kid. The door you entered by clicks shut behind you, it's gone before you can turn to see it, as if it was never there. There is no wall here where you could've drawn it even if you wanted to, I suppose you'll have to go looking for an exit.

I have a rough version of a bit of art I'm going to have for the [[The Idea of Thorns]], in particular, I'm going to take the phrase:

> Lanatar tenecel ynnir

Which is Quenya for:

> Lit "Is (present, negation) Thorn-Idea Ynn's-bane."

or

> Tr: "This is not the Idea of Thorns"

on like, a sketch of a rose or something. I've written the phrase in Old Syriac script, which is gently Tengwar-y (well, I suppose Tengwar is gently Aramaic-adjacent), but should make for a cool puzzle if anyone bothers to dig, and a cool thing otherwise. I don't know that I'm technically using it correctly (AFAIK it should have, e.g., vowel marks under everything? I only add them when the vowel changes), but it looks cool, just needs a few more iterations.

---

I also want to have a proper 'thorn-idea' set of art where the line is just "_lana tenecel ynnir_" (lit: "is (present) thorn-idea ynn-bane", tr: "This _is_ The Idea of Thorns.")
