Well-equipped players start with a d10 provision die, and may spend extra foraging rolls to attempt to upgrade the die, or buy an upgrade from a vendor. The provision die is a [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/09. Subplots/System/Condition Die]] which degrades on a `2-` and upgrades when Foraging/Hunting on a critical success on that roll. A set of provisions may be shared by more than one player, but you _must roll_ for each player using the provisions. You roll provisions twice per day (once in the morning, once in the evening), if your characters skip a meal, CON save against a level of exhaustion. If you have not rolled provisions that day, you must roll your provisions die to see if any provisions have spoiled.

Provisions are an item with base weight:

```ad-warning

These are very rough values for weight/cost.

```

| Size | Weight | Cost  | Description                                 |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| d4   | 250g   | 0.50d | Meager Crumbs, enough for a meal, at most.  |
| d6   | 500g   | 1d    | A little, you might stretch it for the day. |
| d8   | 1.5kg  | 3d    | Enough for a day or two                     |
| d10  | 5kg    | 10d   | A week of rations, if managed well.         |
| d12  | 15kg   | 30d   | A couple weeks of rations.                  |
| d20  | 100kg  | 200d  | You could feed an army.                     |

Players can purchase rations at the [[Pleasantly Finite]], start a project to grow their own provisions, seek other sources, etc.
