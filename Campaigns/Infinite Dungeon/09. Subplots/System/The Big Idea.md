TTRPGs (many of them, and all that I have tried) have an economy problem. We have a one-way flow of resources from GMs to Players. GM pulls encounter out of thin air, fills it with loot, the players defeat it, they get the loot, it goes back into the aether when they spend it.

This, broadly, sucks a bit. Personally, I never know quite how much is too much, and it's hard to have a sense of balance. [[Infinite Dungeon (System)]] is the attempt to provide some gamification around the resource management side of TTRPGs, in the same way the 5e is a combat system with some roleplaying mechanics attached, ID intends to be an inventory/resource management system with a slot designed for your favorite RPG.

The goal is fundamentally this:

1. Make Character Generation Extremely Simple, to encourage... rapid iteration on characters
2. When Characters Die, give the player a new resource, [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/09. Subplots/System/Fame]].
3. Make other resources simpler and _diegetic_, leading too [[Ducats]] for money and [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/09. Subplots/System/Vesper]] for experience.
4. Make lots of ways to spend the new resources to improve character generation

Or, more succinctly, turn every character into a pinata the player really wants to break open.

Consider 5e, which excellently mechanizes combat to the point that it isn't necessary to really think about it. The goal of ID is, on some level, to do the same with loot and rewards. This involves taking over several systems: 

1. Inventory Management
2. Level Progression and Character Creation
3. Background/Downtime Projects

The idea is to provide lots of interesting sinks for these resources, make those sinks very large, very expensive, and very attractive. In this way you really can't 'underserve' resources to the players. Orders are designed to eventually become 'too expensive' to generate characters from, upkeeps grow exponentially. The goal is to encourage players to create multiple characters across multiple orders over time. These orders remain persistent, and since Fame is accrued by the _player_ as the game goes on players can return to older orders and revisit them with new characters while allowing the fame awards to be ever increasing. This makes it so the GM only needs to control the _rate of increase_ of rewards.

Basically it's introducing an inflationary economy to the traditional resource system. By controlling the rate of incoming resources, the GM can buff or nerf the players. Ideally tying the expenditure with the income means that the powerlevel will be kept constant, but if the GM wants to stick with certain orders for longer, they'll necessarily have to increase the rate at which fame is injected into the economy. Similarly if players decided to revisit older prepared content, or you want to restrict the powerlevel of the players somewhat because things have been to easy or you need more turnover, decrease the rate of fame. The resource economy will reset itself as players spent a diminishing resource.

Inflation also allows for a much easier way of quickly building nontrivial orders later -- any trait, once established, is reusable, and since the amount of fame you have grows over time, it's easy to pre-assemble different character generation procedures to generate weird characters.

Ultimately I want the system to elicit these behaviors from players:

1. Players should be excited to retire characters in spectacular ways.
2. Players should be comfortable switching characters/running multiple characters
3. Players should be managing a couple orders at a time, and eventually have a long trail of them.
4. The game should impart the feeling of when you're a kid trying to understand a board game that's just a little too complicated for you, but you like, study the rules intently anyway, but someone accidentally mixed up like, three different rulebooks, so you're really just kind of improvising a melding of lots of different rules you only partly understand. Just a little chaotic, but still with at least some internal logic. Strange mashups should occur.
5. Players might play each other's orders, I think that'd be cool.

For GMs, Orders also provide a lot of narrative resources, an easy source of NPCs and such, and a natural way to add factions. I think it may even be interesting for GMs to have Orders where they negotiate traits in the other direction (where players have the role of GM in the negotiation and vice versa).

A way to think about Orders in particular is that they place a player in the role of the _concept of the Bene Gesserit_ from _Dune_. They are placed in a role of "How do I make a Kwisatch Haderach?", which is _extremely_ fun for the GM because it means your players are always breaking the game, so every encounter _should_ be overtuned. Throw out clearly impossible challenges and make your players work together to build some unholy broken thing to beat it over the course of many increasingly powerful sessions as characters throw themselves into an eternal churning stew of heroic deeds done dirt cheap for sake of accruing ever more [[Fame]] to their Orders' names, finally building the ultimate broken unthing that has more hitpoints than God and powers to match. It also means that players can plot multi-character projects to aid characters they plan to play down the road. It turns players from points into vectors, and vectors are much better at telling you where they're going.

Another aspect of the game is to mimic _World of Warcraft_. Characters there persisted across subsequent expansions, each new area bringing new recurring challenges that were progression-locked. Gear was also an inflationary resource, and ultimately gear gated all content. In Infinite Dungeon, the goal is to provide a sort of 'meta system' that GMs can use to tie multiple adventures across multiple systems, and even allow shared GMing^[If such dreams exist in our real world, I have never seen it] within a single space. GMs can either use player-built orders, or provide orders which players can take over at the start of an adventure. This allows the GM to control the kinds of characters, while still allowing player agency in the design of those characters, it also helps communicate power level much more efficiently, and allows seamless introduction of new systems into the game. If you want to, say, slot in LMoP into your campaign as an aside, and your main game is a 19th level 3.5e game, you can build a 'Standard 5e Character' order and have your players roll from that. ID is just a way to tie a metanarrative together. Thus [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir]]'s oft repeated phrase, "_EVERYTHING IS CANON IN THE I N F I N I T E D U N G E O N_."
