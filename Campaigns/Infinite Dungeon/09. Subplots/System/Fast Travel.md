Major locations, connected by roads to an existing point on the fast travel map, provides a fast travel option once visited. Fast Travel still triggers rolls a roll on the ration die per player, but only `1 + the number of leagues traveling without a road / 4`. So if you travel across two [[Hexcrawling#Region Hexes|Region Hexes]], one of which is off road, and then travel 3 more [[Hexcrawling#Area Hexes|Area Hexes]], one of which is off road, you've travelled a total of 8 leagues off road, so you must roll `1 + 8 / 4 = 3 ` times on your rations, per player. Fast Travel is only fast for the people playing, not the character, you should calculate travel times. If players later build new roads, acquire vehicles, or develop shortcuts, they are responsible for recalculating the time and provisions, and subject to GM approval, those will be used instead.
