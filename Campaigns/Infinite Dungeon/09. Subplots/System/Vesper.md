Vesper is a strange substance that is secreted from the corpses of slain enemies, it also can spontaneously coalesce in
moments of high drama, narrow escape, deadly risk, or whenever else the forces what control the universe decide it
should. Vesper is liquid XP, every milliliter is worth 1XP if consumed. Vesper is also useful for various arcane
experiments. It is liquid at room temperature, but does not absorb into the ground, instead pooling in a viscous puddle
on top of the blood of whatever you murdered in cold blood, you monster. Your character is equipped with a container
capable of holding _exactly_ one level-up-worth of Vesper by Nik, it takes a 2x2 slot in your pack.

Vesper is also used in some downtime actions, and for town upgrades. It may be stored for long periods so long as it is
contained in a canister.
