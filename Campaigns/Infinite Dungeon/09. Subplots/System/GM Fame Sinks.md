One way to bring fame into the system is to build new BBEGs.

GM starts by spending X Fame on a BBEG and Some Lieutenants in their own Orders? Would be cool to make the trait negotiation semi-reciprocal? Too hard to maintain narrative.

Already had adding mechanics to dungeons. Maybe making fame objects more specific -- GM's order(s)'s traits must generate an equivalent # of fame items that get added to the pool?

I think the goal should be something like, start with a blank BBEG that cannot 'manifest'. Create Orders as desired, they can be combinations of any existing trait you've agreed to with the players. You can create characters from these orders by paying the initial costs out of your current Fame pool. When you do, you can also spend 10% of the fame used on the BBEG (also drawn from the fame pool), giving it a new trait on it's own order, or acquiring an heirloom item or a eventual character boon.

When the time is right, you then generate an incarnation of the BBEG from it's own Order, the players fight that as a campaign closer, but the BBEG always makes a last moment escape and gets away.

When you want to close out a BBEG, they don't get away, and you then introduce a new order of the same Fame size.

The upside for the players is the GM will probably approve that overpowered skill, the bad news is they'll get to use it too.
