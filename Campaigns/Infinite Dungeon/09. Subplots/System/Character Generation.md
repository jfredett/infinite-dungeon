Your characters are currently generated like:

1. Roll stats as 3d6, in order.
2. Roll for class from the PHB2024 guide only.
3. Roll for background
4. Roll for hitpoints
5. Roll for any subsequent choice where rolling is possible.
6. If your net modifier is < -6, your character is nonviable and you may reroll if you like.
7. You have no equipment beyond clothes, a simple weapon/focus/etc (<d10 damage die), simple adventuring gear, and a [[Campaigns/Infinite Dungeon/09. Subplots/System/Condition Die|d10 Ration Die]].
