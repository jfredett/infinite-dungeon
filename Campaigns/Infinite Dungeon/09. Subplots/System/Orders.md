Orders are a collection of [[Traits]] which Players use to generate new characters.

Players might want to maintain multiple Orders, or multiple Characters within an order (or across them). Generally speaking this is down to GM choice more than anything, I encourage letting players swap out, I think it helps encourage players to drive more of the fiction; but be aware that it is a vector for PC Bullshit, which may or may not be of value to you.
