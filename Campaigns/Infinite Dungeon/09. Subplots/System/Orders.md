Orders are a collection of [[Traits]] which Players use to generate new characters.

Players might want to maintain multiple Orders, or multiple Characters within an order (or across them). Generally speaking this is down to GM choice more than anything, I encourage letting players swap out, I think it helps encourage players to drive more of the fiction; but be aware that it is a vector for PC Bullshit, which may or may not be of value to you.

Acquisition of a [[Trait]] to an order generally requires only an expenditure of Fame, but specific traits may also require the player doing some great deed or completing a project, or require other resources at GM discretion.

Here are some example order sheets:

## The Standard Issue

Generally, somewhere between 15 and 60m of fame to simply go back to 'the normal' way of rolling a character. For high power systems (5e, PF, etc), the number should be closer to 60. Here you might have traits that return the advantaged rolls for each stat, maybe 1m/each. 12m of fame to unlock each standard PHB class, 1m to choose background, 1m to chose class, and so on. Maybe some gentle upkeep costs on class selection and the like.

For simple systems, err on making this smaller, maybe omit the upkeeps. This gets players to a familiar territory, and may be what some players stick with the whole time, preferring to spend fame equipping characters with objects to boost their more typical level.

## The Purpose Built

Say my order is "Order of the Rogue Badass", I want to specifically gain a 5d6k3 Dex roll, I want to gain the `Sharpshooter` feat, get a natural +1 to hit for all my characters from this order due to our special training, and a final trait that gives me something closer to the original surprise round instead of 5.5's weird 'initiative advantage'. This might be 120m of fame, with upkeep costs on things to help reign in any overpowering that might occur.

## The Weird

I'm building a robot dragon lizard wizard sorlock hexblade fairy nymph demigod; I want to incorporate some weird homebrew I found, whatever. Set prices around it here, make sure to add a solid upkeep cost to avoid toppling the game, and proceed.
