Eventually, a conlang.

--

It should have it's own orthography, highly stylized, ideographic probably. DDD also probably uses some cyrillic-adjacent script for this as well. A sentence is something like a big ideogram that represents the 'Tone' of the sentence (e.g., sarcastic, serious, etc), this also controls the 'form' of the sentence (e.g., imperative, interrogative, etc.) The remaining text removes ambiguity from that primary symbol. The language is written in concentric circles around the main ideogram. A `<>` marker indicates the beginning/end of the clarifying sentence. The closeness of the concentric ring indicates the relative 'importance' of the clarification. Further away = less important.
