A raid is a dungeon which is highly focused on a few boss fights, it is intended to be completed in a few sessions in any given 'instance', and focus heavily on movement mechanics and non-combat or even out-of-character problem solving.

Raids are additionally intended to be repeated, even farmed, by players. The goal is to mimic _World of Warcraft_ or similar MMORPG-style fights, but with the benefit that TTRPGs allow for much more freedom in tactics.

# Repeatability

Raids generally have around four flavors, using [[The Infernal Machine]] raid as an example:

1. Intro -- I'm using this as an intro to the mechanics of ID, so the first version is actually probably going to be
   'easy' by comparison. I'll pivot these fights to be on timers, and make most of the combat about movement and
    survival mechanics. The result will be a fixed amount of fame, xp, and gold taken; and without the end escape set
    piece.
2. Normal -- This is the experience as above, with the set piece and full mechanics, fights still have a timer, but it's
   an enrage timer. Killing during an enrage timer should give a Fame bonus.
3. Heroic -- A souped up version of the above, add more mechanics, increase damage output, increase health.
4. Mythic -- Absolutely unfair mechanics, death a certainty, tpk likely, overtune everything. Beating this -- even
   surviving it -- is an act of unbelievable fame.

Higher levels of raids generally require some amount of invested [[Fame]] or other narrative requirements if a raid is part of a larger adventure, this can be used to manage pace. As always, ignore rules you don't like.
