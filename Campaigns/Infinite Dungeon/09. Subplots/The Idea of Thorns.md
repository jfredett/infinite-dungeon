Below are notes on my specific interpretation of how the idea presents both narratively and mechanically.
# Variant - Tenecel Emmyallensis

This is the book-standard version of The Idea of Thorns
# Variant - Tenecel Parmadilensis

A variant affects [[Edom]] c995CE. This variant is less aggressive, but still extremely deadly and much harder to remove. It manifests physically as a wasting disease that manifests as strange markings on the skin, leading to difficulty breathing and a hacking cough, followed by coma and then death. After death, rose-like blooming vines emerge from the body and spread to fill the area around where the erstwhile sufferer now lies. The fragrance of the blood-red blooms has a chance to infect, increasing in probability with time of and closeness-to exposure.

|      | Minimal | Moderate | Significant    | Swimming in it |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| <1s  | DC3     | DC5      | DC10           | DC15           |

| <15m | DC15    | DC20     | DC25           | DC30           |
| <1h  | DC20    | DC30     | DC35           | Automatic Fail |

The vines of this variant are extremely durable, and frequently grow into [[lanatar-tenecel-ynnir.jpeg|this]] shape, which spells using [[Edomic (Language)]] orthography, "Lanatar Tenecel Ynnir", which is Quenya Elvish for "This is not the idea of thorns, Ynn's Bane."

The vines also display that image as a sort of natural tattoo appearing all over the skin of the individual.

The leaves of this variant are blood red, always dripping with an ichor that, if touched, is a moderate exposure to _T. Parmadilensis_. The ichor itself is clear, sweet smelling, and exudes _old_ magic. Much older than any PC will have any sense for. It may be older than Eret itself. Deep, dark magic.
