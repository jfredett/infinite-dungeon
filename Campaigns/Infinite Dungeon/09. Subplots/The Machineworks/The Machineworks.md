# Description

> You enter the doorway to find that it leads to a strange other world full of pipes and metal confabulations beyond your understanding, at the very edge of your experience. The world around you seems too massive, you feel a strange wind whip around you as you step onto a grated metal deck, looking up, you see a brown and gray sky, looking down, you see an impossible height, and in miniature you see a million million factories all belching unknown gases and fumes out of every myriad smokestack. Looking forward, you see you are atop some ancient spire reaching high into the heavens above where-ever you are. There are large archways to the left and right, and in front of you, on a lower level guarded by only a railing, there is a large mass of metal and gears and wires and pipes sitting in the middle of a room adopt some sort of docking apparatus. It appears to be dormant, the drop to it is about 30m, so it must be at least 10m tall itself, if not taller. It's taller than wide, but not by much.
# Details

A raid consisting of:

- [[Fuel Manifold Room]]
- [[Loading Docks]]
- [[Skybridge]]
- [[The Eye]]
- [[The Infernal Machine]]

It has a [[Loot Table]]

The structure of the dungeon is roughly:

1. Loading Docks are a buff-prevention encounter. Players have an opportunity to weaken the final fight by preventing Vesper transfer. They can also potentially steal some Vesper from this encounter.
2. Flamespew is a DPS check that gates access to the Skybridge mini-depth crawl
3. Trash encounters on the Skybridge are where most of the 'simple' loot will come from.
4. The Eye provides some lore dumps, hooks towards other encounters, and also allows another debuff to IM.
5. The IM fight is a multiphase final boss fight.

# The Machineworks

a 3 boss + 1 puzzle raid. Two bosses, one of spark, one of oil and coal, the final is a giant warforged engine powered
by the first two after they die.

Players enter and see a giant metal statue in the middle of a big open room, there are 3 wing rooms through a short
hallway, as well as some other small rooms that lead back to the Infinite Hallway or to other parts of the dungeon

Traditional(ish) raid style combat.

# Repeatability

Four flavors:

1. Intro -- I'm using this as an intro to the mechanics of ID, so the first version is actually probably going to be
   'easy' by comparison. I'll pivot these fights to be on timers, and make most of the combat about movement and
    survival mechanics. The result will be a fixed amount of fame, xp, and gold taken; and without the end escape set
    piece.
2. Normal -- This is the experience as above, with the set piece and full mechanics, fights still have a timer, but it's
   an enrage timer. Killing during an enrage timer should give a Fame bonus.
3. Heroic -- A souped up version of the above, add more mechanics, increase damage output, increase health.
4. Mythic -- Absolutely unfair mechanics, death a certainty, tpk likely, overtune everything. Beating this -- even
   surviving it -- is an act of unbelievable fame.

This will let the players get an initial round of resources to start to customize their clan, so it's not a total iron
roll after session 2 or so. I expect that they'll die in the intro mode, but hopefully learn pretty quickly what the
mechanics are and how to avoid the majority of problems.

If a player dies on the successful run, they should get a free trait, "Clan Martyr - <Charname>" which gives some kind
of minor boon (maybe bonus Fame when they avenge them?)
