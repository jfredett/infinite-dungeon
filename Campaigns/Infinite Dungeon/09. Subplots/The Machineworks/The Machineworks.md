# The Machineworks

a 3 boss + 1 puzzle raid. Two bosses, one of spark, one of oil and coal, the final is a giant warforged engine powered
by the first two after they die.

Players enter and see a giant metal statue in the middle of a big open room, there are 3 wing rooms through a short
hallway, as well as some other small rooms that lead back to the Infinite Hallway or to other parts of the dungeon

Traditional(ish) raid style combat.

# Repeatability

Four flavors:

1. Intro -- I'm using this as an intro to the mechanics of ID, so the first version is actually probably going to be
   'easy' by comparison. I'll pivot these fights to be on timers, and make most of the combat about movement and
    survival mechanics. The result will be a fixed amount of fame, xp, and gold taken; and without the end escape set
    piece.
2. Normal -- This is the experience as above, with the set piece and full mechanics, fights still have a timer, but it's
   an enrage timer. Killing during an enrage timer should give a Fame bonus.
3. Heroic -- A souped up version of the above, add more mechanics, increase damage output, increase health.
4. Mythic -- Absolutely unfair mechanics, death a certainty, tpk likely, overtune everything. Beating this -- even
   surviving it -- is an act of unbelievable fame.

This will let the players get an initial round of resources to start to customize their clan, so it's not a total iron
roll after session 2 or so. I expect that they'll die in the intro mode, but hopefully learn pretty quickly what the
mechanics are and how to avoid the majority of problems.

If a player dies on the successful run, they should get a free trait, "Clan Martyr - <Charname>" which gives some kind
of minor boon (maybe bonus Fame when they avenge them?)
