Fame is a resource in Infinite Dungeon, it's measures in `minutes`, or `m` as an abbreviation. Where it would be ambiguous (e.g., if you're also referring to `meters`), `min` is used instead.

For players, the main use is upgrading the character generation process to create more powerful or personally interesting characters. They do this by buying "[[Traits]]" for their [[Orders|Order]]. Traits have some cost in Minutes-of-Fame to acquire, and additionally may have an activation cost associated with it.

When players spend Fame, it's not destroyed, it goes into the GM's Fame pool, from there, it can be spent upgrading monsters, unlocking new modes, etc.

How precisely that is going to work is in progress
```

A primary way the GM will spend fame is upgrading [[Raid|Raids]], most raids will tell you how much Fame is needed to unlock a new upgrade. Usually this will come with narrative events that should occur to indicate that it's happening. GMs can also use Fame to upgrade or level up NPCs, Villains, their holdings or hideouts, or to progress their own [[Projects]] more generally.
