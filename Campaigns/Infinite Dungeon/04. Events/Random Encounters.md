Eventually I'd like this to be a little more generic, like:

"Here are a bunch of balanced statblock encounters stripped of all their flavor bits, adjust as you like."
# 5e

Throughout these tables, the notation `Level X Encounter (###R)` is an indicator of roughly how much the _total reward_ for the fight should be; this can be in Vesper, Ducats, or Fame, whatever makes sense and you have budget for.

The "Balanced?" Column is an enum of either: "A", "1", "3", "5", etc. where "A" is 'All', and the others represent which columns have been balanced. "Balance" here means I've looked at it, run it through a calculator, and am sure it at least uses it's XP budget.

Balanced means "An encounter which matches the target XP in the 2024 edition of the DMG balancing rules as interpreted by 5etools." via https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/2024/generate-encounter/

Encounters should be run such that there are usually only a few more monsters than PCs, so if an encounter calls for a total of 20 monsters, and you have 5 PCs, you probably want that to be 3-4 waves of enemies.

The "Run?" column answers if I have run the encounter (as a collection of statblocks, at least) and how many times I've run it.
## Levels 1, 3, 5

### Upper Carpathia

Everything here needs some heavy balance passing
