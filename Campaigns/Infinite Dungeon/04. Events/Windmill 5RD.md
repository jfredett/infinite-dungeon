[[Father John Patrick Francis Mulkanovich]] has been missing for several days, one of the residents of [[Iskavi]] has posted a flyer on the PF's bulletin board mentioning his disappearance and noting he was last seen headed to a currently-out-of-use windmill in one of the fields. Details have been left with Nik.

Nik knows:
- The mills frequently go into disuse when the season doesn't require them, they get partially disassembled, a dangerous task.
- The specified mill has been in disuse for a while on superstition. Several mundane villagers died there after one of the millworkers went mad during the shuttering process. They barricaded the entry and no one has managed to break through it. The locals rumor that it may be someone of the Sort who managed to evade detection well into adulthood.
- The general location of the mill, several leagues west of Isk itself. His directions are: "Follow the lake edge road to where it turns northward again, continue for two leagues due west. There are many Mundane people living in small farms in this area, but few windmills. Look for the one with unnatural light coming from it. You'll know it when you see it."

The way to the mill is dotted with plowed and growing fields of wheat, barley, and other grains. A few

# Initial Notes

 Windmill encounter is a ghostly windmill, it's got ghosts in it.
	- The windmill is fully sealed, but there are grain windows about halfway up the 20m tall structure.
		- Players can climb, or try to bash their way in.
	- The fields around the windmill seem healthy, until you get within about 30m of the mill itself, where the air gets unnaturally cold and the crops seem to exhibit signs of frost.
	- Once inside, there are always three levels. The entry level is where-ever they entered, the lower level is below that (either a basement or first floor), and the upper level is above it.
	- The upper level is magically locked, it can be unlocked by going to the basement level.
	- The lower level contains a number of ghostly millworkers dealing with the millworks. There is a spectral flow of grain into the mill, it keeps getting jammed up.
		- If the players attempt to destroy the mill, show hostility to the ghosts, or otherwise act antisocial, they are attacked by a hard encounter with ghosts.
		- The players can alternatively try to help the ghosts process the grain somehow. If they do, the ghosts dissipate and the sound of an unlocking door is heard.
	- The upper level contains a spectre of a farmer who's fields were burnt by Sordid raiders. He is hostile to the adventurers either for killing his farm hands; or for freeing his slaves (depending on whether the players were hostile or helpful), and speaks in a rural or genteel southern accent as appropriate. He has captured the town Priest, Father Francis John Patrick Mulkanovich, who is quietly invoking the name [[Marcus Aurelius]] ("Kyrie Eleison" maybe instead?) and looking around the room for ways to escape. The party fights and frees Father Mulkanovich or he dies. Upon freedom, Mulkanovich explains he is a vicar of the Catholic Pantheon, and is responsible for maintaining the order and rules of Mundane/Sorted society; and represents a very powerful force. He is not personally Sorted, but has learned -- as all vicars do -- rituals which will bring down the wrath of the Pantheon on any place where the Sorted are doing shitty things to the Mundane. The name he was invoking was to _prevent_ that happening, as it tends to be a pretty 'scorched earth' scenario. Father John is affable and polite, speaks in a very enunciated way. He's a cross between Father Mulcahy from `M*A*S*H` and John Malkovitch
	- Upon victory, the players find quite a bit of vesper, enough to fill them up, and some fame items. Father Mulkanovich only exists if he survives, or else he's a random vicar and the real Mulk is back in Isk, comes (albeit somewhat Timidly) to the PF to inquire after his colleague.
