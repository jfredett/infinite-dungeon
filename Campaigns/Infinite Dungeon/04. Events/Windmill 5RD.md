Total Encounter Loot:

1.6L to 2L Vesper, (high if they defeat the Specters instead of helping them)
20d10 ducats
1 Tentering Gauge, Mulk will offer 10m of fame for it immediately, saying he'll put in a good word for the party with the Church, and that they will want to study any of the Ghost's personal effects for signs of magical mischief; and he'd prefer they didn't get their hands on it till he's had a good study himself. He will be pretty insistent.


[[Father John Patrick Francis Mulkanovich]] has been missing for several days, one of the residents of [[Iskavi]] has posted a flyer on the PF's bulletin board mentioning his disappearance and noting he was last seen headed to a currently-out-of-use windmill in one of the fields. Details have been left with Nik.

Mulk *is not referred to by name* in the poster or by Nik, Nik does not know or care about his name, he's never met him, it's not typical for Innkeeps and Vicars to interact until the settlements are much larger and coordination is required. Innkeeps are not generally sorted themselves, but they're seen as sorted in all but ability.

If the players let this one linger, then the captured priest is unnamed and simply dies. The ghosts remain at the windmill and grow in strength over time.


Nik knows:
- The mills frequently go into disuse when the season doesn't require them, they get partially disassembled, a dangerous task.
- The specified mill has been in disuse for a while on superstition. Several mundane villagers died there after one of the millworkers went mad during the shuttering process. They barricaded the entry and no one has managed to break through it. The locals rumor that it may be someone of the Sort who managed to evade detection well into adulthood.
- The general location of the mill, several leagues west of Isk itself. His directions are: "Follow the lake edge road to where it turns northward again, continue for two leagues due west. There are many Mundane people living in small farms in this area, but few windmills. Look for the one with unnatural light coming from it. You'll know it when you see it."

# Outside

The way to the mill is dotted with plowed and growing fields of wheat, barley, and other grains. A few fields lay fallow, some have flowers or other rotator crops. There are small farmhouses and huts, each with quickly snuffed or sheltered warm light flowing out of them. There are paths with hedgerows you follow, and in the distance you see one unmistakable sight, a large windmill that exudes a shrill blue light deep into the night. Steam seems to be rising from the area, forming a foggy, eerie glow that covers a few hundred feet around the base of the mill.

The mill is situated at the top of a hill, above the treelines of the surrounding forest. The mill stands some 20-25m tall, easily three stories. The air as you climb the hill starts to chill, coming down from the balmy, humid air; to a chilly, damp blanket; to a see-your-breath cold where ice crystals hang in the air. The grain surrounding the mill shows the signs of early spring frost, even though it's the middle of June.

The mill itself glows with a sort of dire, silent thrum. There is a door with a rune etched in vesper-blue on it, the sails of the Mill are tattered, bittersweet and ivies cover it's stone exterior. Various tools scatter around in states of disrepair, the fence that guarded the grain from entry into the workspace and guided the plough-ox during sowing season lie broken, letting the weeds and wheat fall in at their leisure. Out of an upper window, maybe 10m off the ground, blue and white flashes of light escape unhindered into the darkening sky. It was sunset as you approached, it's twilight now, it will be truly, deeply dark soon.

There is the gentle sound of chanting coming from inside.

What do you do?
## Window

A DC20 athletics check can get one into this window, it's small but will fit a medium sized creature if they aren't wearing much armor. If they are heavily equipped, disadvantage the check, if they are encumbered, disallow it. They can try several times, but each failure ticks a 8 slot clock. On the last try, the Ghost upstairs gets wind and comes out with the specters from the lower floor to attack the party.

Once up there, they can lower a rope or other assistive tool, lower the DC to 15 and provide advantage on the roll.

## Barred Door to Entry

Players can attempt to bash the door open, use the failure clock as above, but it's 4 slots. The door has resistance to all damage, and 100HP at AC15
# Entry Floor

The entry level is mostly mechanicals, it's clear from context that the majority of the _work_ happens on the lower floor, where ground wheat would be bagged and hauled onto the lift. This floor is where raw wheatberries are loaded into the mill to be ground, and where the tentering process would take place. The party hears bustle and work from below, but finds the way to the top of the mill, where the gearworks and mechanicals that transfer power from the sails of the mill to the central grindshaft are, is magically locked.
# Lower Floor

4 specters work the mills; they are neutral generally, and are simply working the mill. There are no real millworks here, it's all spectral. The players can investigate and learn about what happened here; if they interfere or behave in an antisocial way to the specters, they attack. This is an extremely deadly encounter for 5 level 1 players, difficult for 5 level 2, and moderate for 5 level 3s.

If the players help the specters, even the attempt wins them some good will, and they will dissipate leaving behind vesper in their wake equivalent to 50% of the XP of the encounter (400ml). How they help is up to them.

The players can learn by investigation, conversation, or other means that:

1. The person who went mad here was their foreman/union boss
2. He had been at the PF shortly before that to post a notice about something, they don't know what.
3. He went there on the advice of the local Vicar, Father Mulkanovich ("Mulk").
4. He had been acting distressed and distant prior to the visit, came back much changed, but went crazy while they were working to disassemble the mill, kept chanting about some 'Old Magic Truncheon' and half-singing some drinking tune.

Facts may not be accessible if they can't talk to the specters, that's their problem.

Upon resolution, the party hears a loud 'click' of an unlocking door coming from upstairs, the chanting gets louder.
# Upper Floor

A Ghost (CR4 but nerfed, no multiattack, but 1 legendary attack, +0 to hit, 1d10 + 3; and Horrific Visage does 1d6 + 3), the ghost who went mad has captured F. Mulk. He irrationally blames Mulk for the problem he went to the PF with not being solved immediately; he was charmed by one of the Sort there (or so Mulk deduces) and sent back to cause chaos, as most of the sorted kind do; present company not excluded, but left without indictment -- he's not mad about it, it's just how the world is. He's upset that he failed to protect one of his wards from them, as is his role.

He (Mulk) is the source of the aforementioned chanting, he was chanting "Kyrie Eleison", which is a prayer "Lord, Have Mercy", in current use, some Mundane also use it as an invocation of "Hey, chill out." -- it is what vicars of the Catholic Pantheon chant to invey _against_ the arrival of [[The Inquisition]], who come when the Sorted get out of pocket. Since he was dealing with something ostensibly caused by the sort, but not wanting the _additional_ chaos that the presence of the _sanctioned sorted_ that make up the Inquistion cause, he was attempting to prevent their arrival.

This is essentially always a fight, but players may try to persuade the ghost as well. However they defeat it, they gain 1.1L of vesper, and find a _Tentering Gauge_, which is a Millworker's device for determining how fine the flour a millstone will produce. It's worth 10m of fame. There are other valuable tools and items worth 20d10 ducats,
