I had a minor disaster destroy chunks of my lab; I have yet to fully repair them. I am also moving all this to use
Obsidian (albeit I do plan to try the Obsidian-in-nvim), but the RPGManager plugin is too nice to pass up I think.

I plan to have it backed with a git repo so this should still see use, and I'll continue to use this repo for system
development as well.

All imported and uploaded and such. Hopefully should help with organizing a bit.
