	4. Voice
		1. Current: 
			1. Discord
			2. Red Bot? (https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)
		2. Future
			1. Mumble (maybe?)
			2. Chat service (maybe?)
	5. Node-Red
		1. Workflow for Whisper + speaker ID + transcript processing by AI
2. Installation Tooling
	1. Compile this repo into a Compendium of Stuff used by the target world
		1. https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-typescript-template (or more modern equiv)
		2. https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/FoundryVTT-Module-Template
	2. Create a sync-back of characters, etc.
3. Foundry Stuff
	1. https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-gmScreen
	2. https://github.com/Ethaks/FVTT-Quench
4.  mdbook stuff
	1. Obsidian Link -> md link. I have a plugin for this, but it'd be nice to have it be a preproc step. Prior art exists
	2. Link fixer for pdf generation -- much more complicated, will need to pick apart the existing plugin
5.  General obsidian stuff
	1. Better integration w/ Foundry (import/export of scripts, journals, etc.)
	2. Better tooling (rpg plugin is well old, but I like the concept/templating at least)
	3. Autolinking (mine the docs for links)
	4. Maybe some limited AI autogeneration of stuff, character summaries, etc. Read the whole thing and add summaries to char pages.

I've looked a bit at, e.g., world anvil and legendkeeper, but I want something self-hosted, and it seems I'll have to make it myself.
