- [ ] Nonraid
	- [ ] Get import/export compendium working
		- [x] move to a module-based workflow
		- [x] pack job to create .pack dbs for loading as compendia
		- [x] sync job to send to foundry for testing
		- This stuff can delay, I think, want to focus on the Usage die stuff this week.
		- [ ] get packs for each compendium type set up
		- [ ] Ideally get the IM stuff such that I can update it per release.
		- [ ] Extract stuff to a library (token finding, explosion stuff, etc)
	- [ ] Infrastructure
		- [x] VM with Foundry, Affine -- maybe just barge?
			- Went w/ Outline/Foundry over the CF tunnel. Former is tied to discord for registration
		- [ ] Selfhost 5e.tools?
			- Started, but the docker setup is quite weird, I might try building my own container or something, not sure how to approach just yet.
		- [ ] Selfhost ddb proxy
		- [ ] Nodered
		- [ ] discord bot
	- [ ] Modules (in rough order of importance)
		- [ ] Usage Die Module
			- [ ] Started, need to get the /roll hooked. Can use flags on charsheets tied to items to show provisions, equipment condition, etc.
			- 
		- [ ] Hexcrawl Encounter stuff
			- [ ] Encounter tables that account for the current weather classification
			- This is going to basically entail coming up with a good rollable-tables workflow, I want to define them in obsidian, export them to csv, then pack them and load them in as a compendium. I also need to have some way to store objects of a more arbitrary shape (like for the D&D potion table)
		- [ ] Weather lookup
			- [ ] Pull CSV/Data from Wunderground
				- [ ] https://pypi.org/project/WunderWeather/
				- [ ] Automated interpreting said data
		- [ ] Terrain Gen Tables
			- [ ] WFC for this, maybe load it into the same wunderground thing?
		- [ ] Travel worksheet (to aid in tracking)
			- maybe just a template in the wiki
			- line for: date left, direction chosen, weather upon departure and arrival, encounter, provisions die, whether or not there was a rest, etc.
- [ ] RAID
	- [ ] IM Raid
		- [ ] Half scale
			- [ ] Flamespew for sure
			- [ ] IM probably
			- [ ] LD should be fine.
		- [ ] IM
			- [ ] Statblocks
				- [ ] IM
					- [ ] N
						- [ ] Exported to this library
			- [x] 5' Adjusted and resquared in Krita
			- [ ] 5' Macroed
				- [x] Barrel Distribution
				- [ ] Floor Explosion Automation
				- [x] Light management
				- [ ] Current status:
					- [ ] Need to export back here
					- [ ] Clean up outputs
					- [ ] Clean up barrel placement to make sure it's in the polygon
					- [ ] Hide the saves for fuel barrels (or obviate them?)
		- [x] Flamespew
			- [x] Flame Scythe Graphic
				- jb2a.breath_weapons02.burst <-- this can be the flame scythe for now, need to create a macro or two to telegraph then play the animation
				- Just need to figure out how to automate all that. >.<
			- [x] 5' Macroed -- something to manage the lights
