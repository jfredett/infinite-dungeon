I want to imagine this as a kind of 'depth-crawl' -- The man shows up with his weather engine and he's powering it with
the souls of children or whatever, he's making farmers rich, and funding schools and churches and picnics and whatever.
Everyone the party runs into seems to love the guy; he's squeaky clean.

But kids keep going missing; parents are distraught.

The depth would basically be a bunch of random encounters you check off till you find a clue, the clue can be a 'red
herring' or a 'real lead', an RH takes you to a table with mostly other RHs, but may contain a real lead, and will
reveal the red herring with 'apparent contradiction'

These three table types define the whole adventure, the party has to solve the mystery by jumping through the tables.

A small example might be a system like:


# Hook:

Real Leads:
1. You run into a lady who has lost her son, she can't find him anywhere. He's been gone for days now, she last saw him
   at the School
2. You run into a farmer who's counting coins as he walks towards the town center, muttering, "This oughta be enough to
   get him to do his magic on my crop, I can't keep up with the way prices are going."
3. You run into a local religious figure who is talking to a construction worker about repairs to the steeple, "Our
   recent benefactor was more than generous, he said 'Spare no cost', and who are we if we do not find humility in our
   hearts to accept a gift?"
Anything else: A random smalltalk with an irrelevant NPC


## Actions


Direct players to investigate (the hook should help with that), they might take overt or covert approaches.

Overt approaches include direct questioning, investigation, or action that would warrant confusion, shock, notice, or
suspicion from NPCs or other characters. If the party asks the lady who has lost her son where she last saw him, that is
an Overt investigation. Overt actions are not necessarily hostile or taken as necessarily bad, but they are intrusive in
a way that indicates you are explicitly attempting to get some information.

Covert approaches include stealth, subterfuge, or covered acts. In a similar way, these _may_ not be bad, for instance,
a lawful good rogue might slip a few extra coins in the farmer's purse via slight of hand, and stealthly follow him to
see what this magic man is going to do for the farmer. However, it is far more likely that they'll loot him and see what
happens when he doesn't.


When players take Overt action, they are more likely to find red herrings, but the path to the end will be shorter.

When they take covert action, they are more likely to find _useful information_, which can help avoid _red herrings_.
The path to the truth will be longer, but it is generally going to be more reliable information.

Players can take Violent or nonviolent action. Violence is the nonconsensual deprival of agency of another individual.
Theft is violence, Assault is violence, Battery is violence, etc. A Barbarian raging and intimidating someone does
violence even if they don't do any physical harm.

When players take violent action, they are much more likely to get Red Herrings, Far more likely to get _Junk
information_ which may appear to circumstantially confirm red herrings. This persists until the GM decides it should
not. This is an anti-murder-hobo device.

If a party gains a sufficient number of red herrings they may be able to form a 'False Conclusion' out of the provided
evidence, this is a 'Bad Ending' and the party will have the truth revealed to them, and suffer some consequence for
being wrong.

If what they did was bad, they might end up getting jailed, or worse.


Investigation should take a few stages to get sufficient evidence together. Players will need to establish Motive,
Means, and Opportunity. Multiple characters (Farmer A and B (one benefiting, one not from the WM), the WM, the Priest, 
the Mayor, and the Lady) have various subsets of these, and several may also be reinforced with red herrings, at least 2
others should have the ability to draw a false conclusion (maybe chosing these at random could be cool), and the tables
would relate to specific encounters with those people that unlock as you gain evidence (i.e., you'll know to ask to be a
the secret meeting of the Mayor and the Lady at night).


Talking to someone uses up a time slot, there are only so many time slots, and time proceeds linearly in a cycle of:

[Dawn, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, Night]

A total of 7 days, starting at Noon on Saturday and ending the next week, will progress. Certain options require certain
combinations of evidence to unlock. People will be at different locations and if they don't know specifically where to
go, they may end up finding someone else at random.


## Characters

Jon of Gomm, The Weather Machine's Owner

Mayor Leonard Oiler
    The self-centered, self-aggrandizing mayor of the town. He is self-serving to the last, and is not subtle about it.
    He is suspected purely due to his selfishness
Mrs. Ann Chavagnor
    A mother who is distraught over her lost son.
Mr. Jim Chavagnor
    A farmer struggling with the drought, there is some suspicion he may have traded his son for the services of the WM.
Whit Chavagnor, the Chavagnor's son
    The MacGuffin
Father Peter Rank, the local parish priest of Our Lady Sasha
    An admittedly strange but generally decent guy, he is a bit airheaded and easily swayed.
A.D. Smythe, a big plantation farmer who is benefitting heavily from Jon's Weather Machine.
    While not aware of any specifics, he is pretty sure Gomm's machine is responsible for the recent issues, but relief
    from the drought means money lines his pockets, so he looks the other way and even helps to some extent.
Sheriff Fred Mises, in the pocket of A.D. is actively framing Father Peter for the recent abductions, at A.D.'s behest,
    though under the guise that it was to keep the town from rioting.


## Opening Scene


Players are moving through a town, perhaps independently, they all arrive at the town square due to the racket being
made there and the strange lights and smoke. It is high noon. The grass around this small town is parched. It has been
dry for a while here. 

"Villains roamed towards your homes
they burnt away the clouds,
But my new invention, my weather engine
shall unleash what they have bound!‚Äù

A whirr of machinery and a whistle of steam. Black smoke issues from it and coats they air in a chemical stink.

"Terraform this desert into paradise!"

The whistles scream and the engine roars

"With my WEATHER MACHINE!"

The giant device starts to spew and sputter and bright blue liquid starts to spray into the air,

"Liquid ice!" the man standing by it shouts and a crack of thunder is followed by rain pouring over the town square...
and _only_ the town square.

"Come, come, talk with my assistants and they will schedule _you_ for a visit from my device, our prices are quite
reasonable, and we offer installment plans!"


The players can:

1. Stay
    - Staying at the town square and talking to the other onlookers
2. Go Deeper (Jon's Encounters: Initial)
    - Trying to inspect the device
    - Trying to talk to the Jon (they don't know his name yet, but it's easy to learn)
    - Trying to set an appointment
2. Go Back
    - Run into Mrs. Cavagnor, who is distraught about her missing son.
    - Run into Mr. Cavagnor, who is drinking midday, counting coins and looking stressed.
    - Run into Father Peter, who is talking with some construction worker about the work to be done on the parish's
    parsonage.
    - Run into Sheriff Mises, who is investigating a missing child case, he's observing Father Peter from down the road,
      poorly hidden, but definitely trying to hide.


## Closing Scene

### Good Ending

Players fight Jon of Gomm, who is actually some kind of demon entity or whatever and has just been doing some eldritch
shit this whole time. The machine was a total headfake. He should be a multi phase fight, he uses bard stuff, his
assistants are like, lesser demons.

### Bad Ending, accuse Father Peter

### Bad Ending, accuse Mr. Cavagnor

Due to his recent drinking, his desparation, and potentially faulty evidence the party can show, this is convincing
enough that The Sheriff arrests Mr. Cavagnor, meanwhile Jon quietly slips town. The Sheriff, distraught that he was
framing the wrong man, gets drunk and confesses to the party his role and direction from Smythe, who was benefitting
immensely from the machine.

No one ever finds Whit. Smythe buys the Cavagnor family farm for pennies, and they are left destitute.

### Very bad ending, Accuse Mrs. Cavagnor

The party is chased out of town by a very angry mob. They may choose to fight the mob, but hundreds of villagers will
attack them all at once.

### Unthinkably bad ending, Blame Whit

The party is chased out of town by a very angry mob. They may choose to fight the mob, but hundreds of villagers will
attack them all at once.

### Neutral ending, Blame A.D. or Mises

This is wrong, but everyone sorta buys it because they're rich and no one likes them anyway. They scurry off to avoid
mod justice, Jon escapes, and nobody ever finds Whit.

### Ending Bonus, Catch A.D.'s complicity

### Ending Bonus, Catch Mises' frameup of Father Peter
