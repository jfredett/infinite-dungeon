# Loot Tables

Loot tables are by dungeon, all items are unidentified. A player can identify in item by expending a scroll of identify
or casting an equivalent spell, or by dint of a downtime job. These are the only methods of identification possible.

Items should be rolled at time of generation by the GM, since different items have different sizes/weights/etc.

Each item from this table may be acquired only `qty` times, when you roll it, check it off the list and if you roll it
again, simply move to the next unchecked item.

Some items are subject to 'Restriction', these can only be generated as loot from the listed bosses.

Descriptions are below.


| Name                   | Qty | Restriction |
| ----                   | --- | ----------- |
| Brace of Spewing Flame | 2   | Flamespew   |
| Precision Optics       | 3   | IM          |
| Laparoscope            | 1   |             |



# Items

## Brace of Spewing Flame

A small metal ring with an open clip, wearing it around your wrist will cause it to bind to your character until death
or dismemberment, whichever comes first.

When wearing the brace, your hands are never cold, and are immune to frostbite or other freezing effects. Your unarmed
attacks gain 1d2 fire damage, and when you take fire damage you may reduce that damage by 1d6.

### Monk Specific

If you are a monk, instead:

Reduce incoming damage by 1d6 + Wis + Monk Level

If incoming damage is reduced to 0, you may spend 1 ki to redirect the attack, casting a `flame bolt` cantrip at an
enemy of your choosing, the damage is 1/2 the amount reduced, round up.

## Precision Optics

A pair of different sized cylindrical tubes containing various lenses, dials, and other components. They offer similar
vision enhancing features as a Spyglass.

Additionally, all ranged and spell attacks made while wearing _Precision Optics_ are +1 to hit; on a crit, add an
additional damage die, your ranged and spell attacks now crit on a 19 or 20.


## Laparoscope

A long, stiff cable, one end is a eyepiece, the other a glass orb. Looking through the eyepiece shows you what the glass
orb can 'see'. Using this to look under doors may result in the glass orb breaking, roll a D20, on a 1, the Laparascope
breaks and no longer shows any image. Everything else keeps working though.

When using this, your heals are all targeted spell attacks. When you cast a heal, first make a Spell attack roll against
the individual, if a party member, the DC is always 12. If you succeed, you heal as normal, but add 1 additional hit die
of healing. If you fail, you do only half healing. If you crit, crit as normal, doubling the total rolled die.
