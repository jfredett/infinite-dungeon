# Loot Tables

Loot tables are by dungeon, all items are unidentified. A player can identify in item by expending a scroll of identify
or casting an equivalent spell, or by dint of a downtime job. These are the only methods of identification possible.

Items should be rolled at time of generation by the GM, since different items have different sizes/weights/etc.

Each item from this table may be acquired only `qty` times, when you roll it, check it off the list and if you roll it
again, simply move to the next unchecked item.

Some items are subject to 'Restriction', these can only be generated as loot from the listed bosses.

Descriptions are below.

When rolling, you should roll `2d6` for each party member. If the result is between 4 and 8, generate a 'Mid' Item for
that character, if it's less than 4, generate a 'Basic' item, if it's greater tan 9, generate a 'Rare' item, if it's a
12, generate a 'Legendary' item.

# Items

## Brace of Spewing Flame

Legendary

A small metal ring with an open clip, wearing it around your wrist will cause it to bind to your character until death
or dismemberment, whichever comes first.

When wearing the brace, your hands are never cold, and are immune to frostbite or other freezing effects. Your unarmed
attacks gain 1d2 fire damage, and when you take fire damage you may reduce that damage by 1d6.

### Monk Specific

If you are a monk, instead:

Reduce incoming damage by 1d6 + Wis + Monk Level

If incoming damage is reduced to 0, you may spend 1 ki to redirect the attack, casting a `flame bolt` cantrip at an
enemy of your choosing, the damage is 1/2 the amount reduced, round up.

## Precision Optics

Mid

A pair of different sized cylindrical tubes containing various lenses, dials, and other components. They offer similar
vision enhancing features as a Spyglass.

Additionally, all ranged and spell attacks made while wearing _Precision Optics_ are +1 to hit; on a crit, add an
additional damage die, your ranged and spell attacks now crit on a 19 or 20.

## Laparoscope

Rare

A long, stiff cable, one end is a eyepiece, the other a glass orb. Looking through the eyepiece shows you what the glass
orb can 'see'. Using this to look under doors may result in the glass orb breaking, roll a D20, on a 1, the Laparascope
breaks and no longer shows any image. Everything else keeps working though.

When using this, your heals are all targeted spell attacks. When you cast a heal, first make a Spell attack roll against
the individual, if a party member, the DC is always 12. If you succeed, you heal as normal, but add 1 additional hit die
of healing. If you fail, you do only half healing. If you crit, crit as normal, doubling the total rolled die.

## Third Eye Monocle

Rare

From: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6ja76f/lets_gather_a_list_of_fun_unique_magical_items/) (Acheron
Gauntlets, but tweaked)

Wearing this like a headband will grant you allow you to roll a DC15 check after using your reaction, if you succeed,
you do not expend your reaction (but cannot react to the same event twice).

Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you may roll d20, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability
check made by you or against you with the value of that roll.

You may only use that feature once, and when you long rest, you lose the value of that roll.

(See Portent, p117 of PHB, this is a limited version of that).

## Scholar’s Monocle

Mid

From: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6ja76f/lets_gather_a_list_of_fun_unique_magical_items/)

This monocle is a gold-rimmed glass monocle. While wearing this lens in a library, you have advantage on Intelligence
(Investigation) checks to find relevant books and information.

## Dr'ard Hive

Mid

A strange, small box containing innumerable metal and magnetic parts, this item can store any number of spells so long
as their total spell level does not exceed level 4. i.e., it can store 4 level 1 spells, 2 level 2, 2 level 1 and 1
level 2, etc.

Spells are stored in the Dr'ard Hive during a long rest and remain there until expended. Once expended, they are no
longer in the Dr'ard Hive and must be re-stored at a long rest.


## Extra Cable

Basic

A long section of cable and wire, woven together, pulled from a part of the Infernal Machine. It is infused with arcane
magic and acts as a Whip +1. On a hit, the target must pass a DC8 + attack mod test or take an additional die of damage.

## Infernal Arrow

Basic

found in qtys of 2d4

Does fire damage, can set things on fire

## Canister of Fuel

Basic

found in qtys of 2d4

An improvised grenade, does 2d6 damage in a 5' radius about a point, dex save or suck
