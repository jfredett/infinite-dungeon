# Flamespew

Flame boss is in a machine room, the players need to turn on sprinklers to manage the fires that drop on the grown every
turn, up to four active fires. when all four are active, the players do a con throw or take a point of exhaustion from
the heat. When the fires are active, they spawn 2 flame sprites per round; when they are inactive, a Steam Geist will
spawn on a won coinflip. Steam Geists should be about 3 flame sprites worth of challenge.

When all the fires are halted (either by turning on the sprinkler system by turning the 4 valves scattered around the
room, then all the remaining monsters coallesce into the actual boss, a Flame Geist, stronger than all the others, and
possessing the following abilities:

1. Can place a 20ft diameter circle of flame that does 4d6 damage to any creature entering or ending their turn inside.
2. Can swing a giant flaming scythe around the whole room that moves 1/6th around every turn, he can arbitrarily change
   directions by using a legendary action that telegraphs
3. Shoots fireballs, flame missiles (like a magic missile but with flame damage), and can "Stoke" which recovers some HP
   and increases all the damage by 2 die every time they do so.

Players coming up with clever counter strategies should be rewarded.

On death, drops boss loot, and exposes some wires that need to be repaired in order to activate the machine in the
center of the arena.

If the players remember to turn back all the valves, the final boss gets nerfed.
