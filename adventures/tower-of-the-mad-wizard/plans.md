# The Machineworks

a 4 boss raid. Two bosses, one of spark, one of oil and coal, the final is a giant warforged engine powered by the first
two after they die.

Players enter and see a giant metal statue in the middle of a big open room, there are 3 wing rooms through a short
hallway, as well as some other small rooms that lead back to the Infinite Hallway or to other parts of the dungeon

Traditional(ish) raid style combat.

## Flame

Flame boss is in a machine room, the players need to turn on sprinklers to manage the fires that drop on the grown every
turn, up to four active fires. when all four are active, the players do a con throw or take a point of exhaustion from
the heat. When the fires are active, they spawn 2 flame sprites per round; when they are inactive, a Steam Geist will
spawn on a won coinflip. Steam Geists should be about 3 flame sprites worth of challenge.

When all the fires are halted (either by turning on the sprinkler system by turning the 4 valves scattered around the
room, then all the remaining monsters coallesce into the actual boss, a Flame Geist, stronger than all the others, and
possessing the following abilities:

1. Can place a 20ft diameter circle of flame that does 4d6 damage to any creature entering or ending their turn inside.
2. Can swing a giant flaming scythe around the whole room that moves 1/6th around every turn, he can arbitrarily change
   directions by using a legendary action that telegraphs
3. Shoots fireballs, flame missiles (like a magic missile but with flame damage), and can "Stoke" which recovers some HP
   and increases all the damage by 2 die every time they do so.

Players coming up with clever counter strategies should be rewarded.

On death, drops boss loot, and exposes some wires that need to be repaired in order to activate the machine in the
center of the arena.

If the players remember to turn back all the valves, the final boss gets nerfed.


## Fuel

In a storage/chemical facility, there are a network of pipes which must be adjusted to direct the flow of fuel from the
tanks to the engine in the center of the facility. Unfortunately, the pipes are being attacked by Metal-eating Mechanical
Spiders. When the players attempt to repair, they have a chance of irritating the spiders and causing them to come
pouring out into the room, creating a massive horde fight. When the players have successfully repaired the facilities,
the spiders will abate. Alternatively, the spiders hate fire.

But then again so does everything else in this room. Fire attacks may cause Fireball-like explosions. There are
explosive barrels that roll into and through the room periodically via automation that is still functional, these can
cause chain reactions that continually occur, doing fireball like damage and knocking creatures back proportional to how
close they are to the center of the explosion.

The players can simply escape the room, there is enough fuel to power the machine, but if they repair more of the lines,
they can also power turret emplacements in the main area. These turrets are hostile to everything, unless reprogrammed
in the next room.

## Oxygen

Giant bellows which have to be fixed in order to open the final door. These are only viewable through an observation and
control room; it contains a large mechanical computer that the players can use. All instructions are written in a
language the players can't understand, and it takes significant study time to unpack. This room only opens after the
other two bosses are defeated, and while it is safe to spend time there, the longer they spend the stronger the final
boss becomes. This is signposted by rumblings and other such things coming from back the way the players came.

The control facility itself is a massive skybridge that rings the facility, from the entry side, the players cannot see
into the main arena, but if they venture around it, they can eventually get a view and see the giant metal thing
starting to come to life below.

Players can use the computer to gain information about this part of the ID, learn what the machine is, etc, but the
computer doesn't have any information outside this section and just refers to a 'Permission Error' (albeit in the
unknown language).

Players can attempt to decipher the language using a relevant check at a very high difficulty requiring lots of study
over many sessions (if they survive), progress is reset if the player does not explicitly leave notes in a recoverable
location, though any unrecoverable notes are taken to the Stygian Library where they can be recovered.

### Around the Ring

there are 4 rooms, the initial control room with the computer; then there is an Employee Break Room

> You enter what appears to be some kind of break room, a few scattered round tables, simple chairs, a counter against one wall with shelves, a coffee station, an icebox. The room is light with a light that feels unnatural and harsh, though you can't quite tell where. The ceiling feels a little too low, it makes you feel ill-fit to the space, it's quite uncomfortable to be here. On the walls are a variety of posters with 'motivational' messages, among them:

Then there is an "Upper Garden" -- which has a small shed with a book about the Secret Garden of Ynn.

Then there is a [[depth/Room Descriptions/The Golem Factory.md]], which is an otherwise unrelated battle room.

## The Infernal Machine

The Infernal Machine can be activated when the players have at least defeated the 'Flame' encounter. All interaction
with it's control panel is rejected prior to that. Additionally, they must activate the panel by going to the skybridge
control room first. They can learn of a secret way that the players can know and they can use later on to bypass this if
the players decide to farm the Raid.

### Phase 1: The Infernal Machine

The Infernal Machine has three modes:

Mode 1: Flamespew

The IM assumes the powers of the Flame Geist and adopts it's abilities, but with the addition that the blade might
occasionally advance by two sectors of the ring.

When the Flamespew mode is active, at the end of each round, a number of chemical barrels appear. These will accumulate
and could cause chain reactions.

In this mode it has high saves but is weak to being extinguished. Savvy players might be able to use the environment to
their advantage.

The Flamespew stays at range, using _Flamewalk_ to blink around the arena, staying distant from the players.

It does not summon any adds in this mode.

Mode 2: Spidertron

The IM spits out mechanical legs and chases the party, making devastating multiattacks. In this mode it has resistance
to lots of things but poor saves. So it has to rely on it's legendary resistance pool to survive. Players can tax this
pool deliberately as another way to defeat the boss.

It summons Spiderlings from the previous section in this mode at the end of every turn, 2d4 spiderlings flood out as a
single unit.

Mode 3: Refuel

In this mode the IM returns to the center and activates a shield that takes 2d20 + 10 attacks to destroy. It can be
dealt 1/(number-of-cables) of it's total life by destroying any of the much weaker (100HP) cables that connect to it.
There are 3+1d4 cables total.

During this mode, the IM summons a flame spirit after every players turn until there are 2 for each player. They
relentlessly gang up on players in pairs.

At the end of every round, the IM regains 10% of it's life total. This lasts for 1d6 rounds, determined when entered. If
the IM Overheals, it gains half as much temporary HP.

If the players manage to destroy all the cables, all the healing is lost and the IM is stunned for a round, and all
attacks on it automatically hit and are natural crits.


### Phase 2: Rapid Unplanned Disassembly

The defeat of the machine has destablized the structure, there is a door to the north you did not previously notice, it
is opening.

But wait -- the loot! What do you do?

1. Grab Something!
2. Run away

Every time you choose to grab something, roll against a progressing DC check, starting at 5, and adding 1 each time you
choose to grab something. If you fail, roll on the failure consequence table, if you succeed, roll and the GM will tell
you what you grabbed.

Players are encouraged to bullshit the GM, but the GM decides what is an appropriate skill check. If no skill is
appropriate but the GM likes the idea, the player can roll a luck check. If no skill is appropriate and the GM does not
like the idea, they may instruct the player to make a bad luck check.

A bad luck check comes in three flavors.

1. Bad day - Roll with disadvantage.
2. Bad week - Roll with a +5 to the DC and disadvantage
3. Bad time - Roll a size smaller die with disadvantage on the failure consequence table, immediately.

So don't overdo it.

When you Run Away, make a Dex save against a DC of 10 + the number of things you're still carrying, if you fail, roll on
the failure consequence table, then save Dex again. Do this until you save.


Failure Consequence

1. You can't take it with you, you die.
2. A piece of the Infernal Machine severs 1d4 limbs.
3. A falling shard of glass slices your {left,right} {arm, leg}, you take 4d10 damage and are bleeding. Drop 1d2 held
   items. Coins are kept in purses of at most 40 coins. Denominations cannot be changed until you are in town and there
   is a bank to do it at.
4. You drop some of what you were carrying, lose 1d3 + 1 items
5. Something you picked up you assumed was dull, but was actually sharp, it poked you and you think it broke skin, take
   1d4 damage. Roll a Con save, on failure, you are bleeding.
6. You lucky duck, nothing bad happens.
7. A burst of unexpected steam burns you, take 2d6 damage; roll a Dex save, if you fail, drop 1d4 held items.
8. Roll twice on this table again, ignore this option.

Loot Table:

Each successive item of loot should be some bauble worth progressively more money. At DC5, it should be worth about 5%
of a level, then 6%, etc. This encourages players to keep digging, play with the progression till the players walk away
with XP sufficient for a level or so for a character at least. Ideally not all the players stay behind, maybe some
eventually cast shields or other spells to maximize loot withdrawl. At DC10, start making the consequences more frequent
by rolling twice on the consequence table. Then at DC15 roll four times, at DC20 the building collapses and all inside
perish.

For the actual items, describe bits and bobs of the machine itself, it's internals contain gold, rubies, and other
clockwork items that are probably worth a small fortune. There is also some obviously magical components to the
magically inclined that have significant value.
