# The Machineworks

a 4 boss raid. Two bosses, one of spark, one of oil and coal, the final is a giant warforged engine powered by the first
two after they die.

Players enter and see a giant metal statue in the middle of a big open room, there are 3 wing rooms through a short
hallway, as well as some other small rooms that lead back to the Infinite Hallway or to other parts of the dungeon

Traditional(ish) raid style combat.

## Flamespew

Flame boss is in a machine room, the players need to turn on sprinklers to manage the fires that drop on the grown every
turn, up to four active fires. when all four are active, the players do a con throw or take a point of exhaustion from
the heat. When the fires are active, they spawn 2 flame sprites per round; when they are inactive, a Steam Geist will
spawn on a won coinflip. Steam Geists should be about 3 flame sprites worth of challenge.

When all the fires are halted (either by turning on the sprinkler system by turning the 4 valves scattered around the
room, then all the remaining monsters coallesce into the actual boss, a Flame Geist, stronger than all the others, and
possessing the following abilities:

1. Can place a 20ft diameter circle of flame that does 4d6 damage to any creature entering or ending their turn inside.
2. Can swing a giant flaming scythe around the whole room that moves 1/6th around every turn, he can arbitrarily change
   directions by using a legendary action that telegraphs
3. Shoots fireballs, flame missiles (like a magic missile but with flame damage), and can "Stoke" which recovers some HP
   and increases all the damage by 2 die every time they do so.

Players coming up with clever counter strategies should be rewarded.

On death, drops boss loot, and exposes some wires that need to be repaired in order to activate the machine in the
center of the arena.

If the players remember to turn back all the valves, the final boss gets nerfed.

### Variants

In Intro, he does `Party Size / 2` round down flame bolts after each players turn at a random player, the wall of flame
is highly telegraphed (counters on the floor or something), and maybe casts like, one highly telegraphed downcasted
fireball.

In Normal, as described, does `Party Size - 1d(Half-Party Size Round Down)` Firebolts after each players turn, the wall
of flame is telegraphed, and casts a L3 fireball on it's turn at the player with the most health / has recently done the
most damage to it.

In Heroic, Flamebolt after each player's turn, Scorching Ray or Fireball at will on their turn. Wall is only telegraphed
on a missed coinflip.

In Mythic, Cast `1d3` Flamebolts at random targets each turn, casts Scorching Ray and Fireball on it's turn, summons
Iron-Ants as adds.

## Ants go Marching

An open air section overlooks a massive sprawling network of pipes and widgets. These all coallesce to feed their
contents to great machines in the middle distance. tanks to the engine in the center of the facility. Buzzing, pilotless
ornithopters haul man-sized barrels to and fro, setting them down only to pick them up again. There are various pipes and
connection points here, all helpfully labelled, none of them in a language you know. With some effort, it can be worked
out that the fuel is not being delivered to the correct place, due to some obvious subsystem not being active. The
players can activate the subsystem in a few ways.

The easiest is an override button. There are three massive light fixtures, two green and one red. Beneath them are large
buttons. Press button, roll initiative as dozens of mechanical ants rush out to -- at first -- start moving the fuel
barrels, but upon noticing the players, blare a siren and start attaching.

Second is to activate them from the upper control room, this does not work/the players do not find this option until
they've done the ant encounter once.

The ornithopters can be _deactivated_ from the control room as well, this weakens the _Refuel_ phase of the boss
significantly. See the next section.

Everything in this room is explosive. When barrels of various chemical fuels explode, it does a Fireball-like
explosions. There are explosive barrels that roll into and through the room periodically via automation that is still
functional, these can cause chain reactions that continually occur, doing fireball like damage and knocking creatures
back proportional to how close they are to the center of the explosion.

Players are swarmed by the ant-bots, but there are different classes of them, some are soldier-type and directly attack
the players, some are swarmer type that crawl on the players and turn to acid, auto-hitting for small damage and
corroding armor, permanently reducing it's AC. If it hits bare skin, it reduces Constitution.

The players can simply escape the room, the bots will provide enough fuel to power the machine, but several ports are
blocked, and the bots won't bother to unblock them, simply walking up, then turning around. The players can attempt to
clear the debris either through attacks or skill checks. Skill checks are faster, but take an entire turn, reaction
included, if the player passes, the debris is clear.

The ant-bots never stop spawning.

Clearing this debris does several things:

1. If the players do nothing else, it makes the IM fight _harder_. IM uses the extra fuel to make all it's phases
   stronger, narrate the fuel flowing into the IM, bypassing a manifold or something.
2. If the players get to the skybridge, an obvious clue points them to enable some anti-fire emplacements that prevent
   the swinging fire arc and do some damage to the IM. Big sign showing a symbol for 'fire suppression', "There's a sign
   with a little flame and like, a little turret shooting something on it, a red light below it and an unthrown lever."
3. If the players dig around in the archives, they might find other helpful tools that the fuel can power, including
   whatever you like, but maybe something that extends the loot phase, etc. This can be discovered in the Control Room
   Section.

### By Mode

In Intro mode, the Ants are present, but they are 1-shottable and relatively benign, a swarm will kill a player, but
they pay less attention to them overall.

In Normal mode, as described above, should still be 1-2 shots per ant, but the attacks are deadlier, probably borrow a
clay golem block for this or something like

In Heroic, the ants (now "Red Ants") are stronger and tankyer, 3-4 shots to kill, does some lingering damage, maybe a con save against
painful poison, which gives them negative temporary hit points (lowers max health until cured/wears off after 1d4 hours)

In Mythic, the ants (now "Iron Ants") have the fire regen ability like Iron Golems, they are summoned by both Flamespew and IM to assist
them.

## Oxygen

Giant bellows which have to be fixed in order to open the final door. These are only viewable through an observation and
control room; it contains a large mechanical computer that the players can use. All instructions are written in a
language the players can't understand, and it takes significant study time to unpack. This room only opens after the
other two bosses are defeated, and while it is safe to spend time there, the longer they spend the stronger the final
boss becomes. This is signposted by rumblings and other such things coming from back the way the players came.

The control facility itself is a massive skybridge that rings the facility, from the entry side, the players cannot see
into the main arena, but if they venture around it, they can eventually get a view and see the giant metal thing
starting to come to life below.

Players can use the computer to gain information about this part of the ID, learn what the machine is, etc, but the
computer doesn't have any information outside this section and just refers to a 'Permission Error' (albeit in the
unknown language).

Players can attempt to decipher the language using a relevant check at a very high difficulty requiring lots of study
over many sessions (if they survive), progress is reset if the player does not explicitly leave notes in a recoverable
location, though any unrecoverable notes are taken to the Stygian Library where they can be recovered.

Players can control an aspect of each of the three fights indirectly. They can de-activate the ornithopters, making the
`Refuel` phase not work at all, the IM won't ever use it. They can also activate the spiders, skipping the spider fight
entirely. Finally, they can disable the Flame Geist's fuel line, completely negating the rest of the dungeon and
allowing free loot of the IM with no risk to the structure. This permanently closes this section of the ID when the
players leave, and the door not longer appears in whatever [[Hilbert's Hallway]] it appeared in. It may _generate again_
randomly during exploration.

### Around the Ring

there are 4 rooms, the initial control room with the computer; then there is an Employee Break Room

> You enter what appears to be some kind of break room, a few scattered round tables, simple chairs, a counter against
> one wall with shelves, a coffee station, an icebox. The room is light with a light that feels unnatural and harsh,
> though you can't quite tell where. The ceiling feels a little too low, it makes you feel ill-fit to the space, it's
> quite uncomfortable to be here. On the walls are a variety of posters with 'motivational' messages, among them:

![](https://i.redd.it/pmg78j8vion81.jpg)


Then there is an "Upper Garden" -- which has a small shed with a book about the Secret Garden of Ynn.

Then there is a [[depth/Room Descriptions/The Golem Factory.md]], which is an otherwise unrelated battle room.

## The Infernal Machine

The Infernal Machine can be activated when the players have at least defeated the 'Flame' encounter. All interaction
with it's control panel is rejected prior to that. Additionally, they must activate the panel by going to the skybridge
control room first. They can learn of a secret way that the players can know and they can use later on to bypass this if
the players decide to farm the Raid.

### Phase 1: The Infernal Machine

The Infernal Machine has three modes:

Mode 1: Flamespew

The IM assumes the powers of the Flamespew and adopts it's abilities, but with the addition that the blade might
occasionally advance by two sectors of the ring.

When the Flamespew mode is active, at the end of each round, a number of chemical barrels appear. These will accumulate
and could cause chain reactions.

In this mode it has high saves but is weak to being extinguished. Savvy players might be able to use the environment to
their advantage.

The Flamespew stays at range, using _Flamewalk_ to blink around the arena, staying distant from the players.

It does not summon any adds in this mode.

Mode 2: Ant-bots

The IM spits out mechanical legs and chases the party, making devastating multiattacks. In this mode it has resistance
to lots of things but poor saves. So it has to rely on it's legendary resistance pool to survive. Players can tax this
pool deliberately as another way to defeat the boss.

It summons Ants from the previous section in this mode at the end of every turn, 2d4 ants flood out as a
single unit.

Mode 3: Refuel

In this mode the IM returns to the center and activates a shield that takes 2d20 + 10 attacks to destroy. It can be
dealt 1/(number-of-cables) of it's total life by destroying any of the much weaker (100HP) cables that connect to it.
There are 3+1d4 cables total.

During this mode, the IM summons a flame spirit after every players turn until there are 2 for each player. They
relentlessly gang up on players in pairs.

At the end of every round, the IM regains 10% of it's life total. This lasts for 1d6 rounds, determined when entered. If
the IM Overheals, it gains half as much temporary HP.

If the players manage to destroy all the cables, all the healing is lost and the IM is stunned for a round, and all
attacks on it automatically hit and are natural crits.


### Phase 2: Rapid Unplanned Disassembly

The defeat of the machine has destablized the structure, there is a door to the north you did not previously notice, it
is opening.

But wait -- the loot! What do you do?

1. Grab Something!
2. Run away

Every time you choose to grab something, roll against a progressing DC check, starting at 5, and adding 1 each time you
choose to grab something. If you fail, roll on the failure consequence table, if you succeed, roll and the GM will tell
you what you grabbed.

Players are encouraged to bullshit the GM, but the GM decides what is an appropriate skill check. If no skill is
appropriate but the GM likes the idea, the player can roll a luck check. If no skill is appropriate and the GM does not
like the idea, they may instruct the player to make a bad luck check.

A bad luck check comes in three flavors.

1. Bad day - Roll with disadvantage.
2. Bad week - Roll with a +5 to the DC and disadvantage
3. Bad time - Roll a size smaller die with disadvantage on the failure consequence table, immediately.

So don't overdo it.

When you Run Away, make a Dex save against a DC of 10 + the number of things you're still carrying, if you fail, roll on
the failure consequence table, then save Dex again. Do this until you save.


Failure Consequence

1. You can't take it with you, you die.
2. A piece of the Infernal Machine severs 1d4 limbs.
3. A falling shard of glass slices your {left,right} {arm, leg}, you take 4d10 damage and are bleeding. Drop 1d2 held
   items. Coins are kept in purses of at most 40 coins. Denominations cannot be changed until you are in town and there
   is a bank to do it at.
4. You drop some of what you were carrying, lose 1d3 + 1 items
5. Something you picked up you assumed was dull, but was actually sharp, it poked you and you think it broke skin, take
   1d4 damage. Roll a Con save, on failure, you are bleeding.
6. You lucky duck, nothing bad happens.
7. A burst of unexpected steam burns you, take 2d6 damage; roll a Dex save, if you fail, drop 1d4 held items.
8. Roll twice on this table again, ignore this option.

Loot Table:

Each successive item of loot should be some bauble worth progressively more money. At DC5, it should be worth about 5%
of a level, then 6%, etc. This encourages players to keep digging, play with the progression till the players walk away
with XP sufficient for a level or so for a character at least. Ideally not all the players stay behind, maybe some
eventually cast shields or other spells to maximize loot withdrawl. At DC10, start making the consequences more frequent
by rolling twice on the consequence table. Then at DC15 roll four times, at DC20 the building collapses and all inside
perish.

For the actual items, describe bits and bobs of the machine itself, it's internals contain gold, rubies, and other
clockwork items that are probably worth a small fortune. There is also some obviously magical components to the
magically inclined that have significant value.

# Repeatability

Four flavors:

1. Intro -- I'm using this as an intro to the mechanics of ID, so the first version is actually probably going to be
   'easy' by comparison. I'll pivot these fights to be on timers, and make most of the combat about movement and
    survival mechanics. The result will be a fixed amount of fame, xp, and gold taken; and without the end escape set
    piece.
2. Normal -- This is the experience as above, with the set piece and full mechanics, fights still have a timer, but it's
   an enrage timer. Killing during an enrage timer should give a Fame bonus.
3. Heroic -- A souped up version of the above, add more mechanics, increase damage output, increase health.
4. Mythic -- Absolutely unfair mechanics, death a certainty, tpk likely, overtune everything. Beating this -- even
   surviving it -- is an act of unbelievable fame.

This will let the players get an initial round of resources to start to customize their clan, so it's not a total iron
roll after session 2 or so. I expect that they'll die in the intro mode, but hopefully learn pretty quickly what the
mechanics are and how to avoid the majority of problems.

If a player dies on the successful run, they should get a free trait, "Clan Martyr - <Charname>" which gives some kind
of minor boon (maybe bonus Fame when they avenge them?)
