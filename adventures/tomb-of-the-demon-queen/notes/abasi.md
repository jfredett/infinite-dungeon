Slight accent, Caribbean-ish or maybe. `th` -> `d`, think Canadian French but via a Haitian.

## If the players take the history lesson

Abasi makes a vague Catholic gesture

The hate grows on his face as he says the names.

His voice trails off...

Abasi gains some respect for the adventurers

Abasi loses some respect for the adventurers

## "How long do we have?"

> "I don't know. Days? Hours? Weeks? Minutes? I just know that the signs of her return are coming. Unusual darkness,
> strange alignments of stars, ripples of arcane evil flowing from the place where the tomb should be."


## "Can she be killed?"

> "Do you think they did not try? She was practically a god. We were lucky to have bound her at all. The sacrifice of it
> -- it was immense, you can't understand."

If Abasi already has a poor opinion, this does nothing to improve it. If he has an alright or good opinion, he may take
the question more seriously:

> "Not through any means the ancient members of my order could find, but it has been long and magic has grown in this
> world, perhaps there is a way now."

In either case:

> "We ... the ancients of my order, it is written that they used an ancient relic, the Dial of Aten, to bind the magicks
> needed to control and suppress her; it may be possible to renew it and continue to use it again."

## "What if you're wrong?"

Abasi ponders:

> "Then we will go into an uncrossable desert searching for a tomb which is not on any map because it does not exist. It
> will be hot, we will waste many days, and at the end you will have nothing by sore bones and wasted hours. Such is the
> life of every adventurer, no?"

## Logistics

Refer to the sourcebook, this doesn't need lines.

## "What about the rest of you/Where is the rest of your order?"

> "They're dead."

If the players press.

> "They're all dead. Most of old age and apathy. I am the only one left."
