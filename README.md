# Infinite Dungeon

A (relatively) system-agnostic character-funnel roguelite system for TTRPGs, but also a collection of notes from the
first attempts at running this system.

## Prologue: Monster Hunting

You are a 9th level adventurer; you hunt monsters. Maybe you work alone, maybe you know some of your future compatriots
already, by reputation or otherwise. You live on a planet called _Eret_, a world not dissimilar from our own, similar
geography, though highly dissimilar history and politics. On _Eret_, magic never left the world as it did on Earth. This
resulted in profound changes in social, political, and religious development. Of _course_ the gods existed, they
_literally showed up_ from time to time. Why invent cars and trains and international logistics when you can just use
_Send_ and _Teleport_ and whatever other spell makes sense. It is said that, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic", but the converse is also true -- any sufficiently arcane magic is indistinguishable from
technology.

It is impossible to fully stop the progress of either, but one may and often does dominate the other. So in this world,
technology has only made it to the late 19th century or so.

You find yourself glommed together with a group of other adventurers, you've been having some lousy luck -- contracts
appropriate to your ability (and more importantly, sufficient to be worth the expense of the endeavor) have been few and
far between. You're down to your last few ducats when you hear of a crazy man railing about some ancient Demon Queen.
Sounds like it's right up your alley.


## The first Boss: Scheduling


### Cadence and timing

We'll be doing a week on/week off schedule. I expect sessions to be around the 2-3 hour mark, aiming to end before 3h
and after 2h, but without a fixed end to accomodate being able to finish up a fight or other encounter.

### Possible Timeslots

#### Closed Options

Mondays, Wednesdays

Cros: Every other friday could work, but not ideal

#### Open Options

Tuesdays, 7ET - 11ET, 6CT - 10CT
Thursdays, 7ET - 11ET, 6CT - 10CT
1st/3rd Friday 7ET - 11ET, 6CT - 10CT
