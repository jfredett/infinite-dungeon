# Infinite Dungeon

A (relatively) system-agnostic character-funnel roguelite system for TTRPGs, but
also a collection of notes from the first attempts at running this system.

For the moment, if you are a part of any of my (jfred's) games, please _do not
continue reading anything in this repo_. At some point you'll get to see it, but
everything is in one place right now and 

I prefer to work with my garage door open, If you chose to be spoiled I cannot
stop you, but don't ruin it for anyone else, and if I catch y'all snooping I'll
shut the door again.

## Setting/System

A lot of the work here is about integrating a bunch of other source books into
the lore of the custom setting. As such, I believe all the use of terms,
concepts, and other elements of those other source books are incorporated here
in a manner compliant with Fair Use, all the work contained in this repo over
which I have right to share is shared under the terms of CC-BY-SA-NC, or by the
license specified in LICENSE if that file exists, or by more restrictive license
called out in the file itself or by name in the LICENSE file.

If you are an author of the source books I incorporate into whatever the hell
this all is, and you see something you'd prefer I not reference, use, or
otherwise share in this repo, please create an issue so that I can address your
concern efficiently.

## Repo Rules

1. Names of files should be all lower-case with hyphens instead of spaces.
    - Some exception may be made as in the case of `gelatinous-cUber` to help avoid mispronunciation at a glance.
2. Markdown ends in `.md`, not `.mkd`
3. Cited, included, or referenced works should be added to REFERENCES, ideally with backlinking but this is not a
   requirement.
