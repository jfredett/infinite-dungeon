You may swap this die for any other die of the same size, the replaced die is discarded unless prevented by another effect.                                                                                                                                                 |

| Make Choice         | Varies depending on the choice                                                | 1-5m   | Where you presently roll, you may instead choose. Name a part of character creation where the instructions dictate you must role, instead, you now choose a value you could have otherwise rolled. The choice is fixed at _trait selection time_. So if you're choosing a class, activating this trait is _equivalent to choosing that class_, etc. |
