## Standard Traits

These are traits with standardized effects and costs.

| Trait       | Initial Cost                   | Upkeep | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swap DX     | 5m                             | 0m     | Pick an X, Roll 1 additional die during character creation of a size X. You may swap this die for any other die of the same size, the replaced die is discarded unless prevented by another effect.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Extra Swap  | 1m                             | 1m     | When using a swap die, instead of discarding the swapped die, you may then treat it as a swap die of that size, after swapping that die, the swapped die is discarded as before.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Feat        | 5m                             | 1m     | Pick a Feat, characters of this order gain the feat upon activating this trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Make Choice | Varies depending on the choice | 1-5m   | Where you presently roll, you may instead choose. Name a part of character creation where the instructions dictate you must role, instead, you now choose a value you could have otherwise rolled. The choice is fixed at _trait selection time_. So if you're choosing a class, activating this trait is _equivalent to choosing that class_, etc. |
