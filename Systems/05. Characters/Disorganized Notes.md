Characters have 4 "Core Stats"

Mind - One's intellect, empathy, ability to communicate, charm.
Might - One's strength, of the coarse or fine muscles. A Bard's might is in the fine muscles, a Barbarian's in the large.
Mettle - One's inner strength, sticktoitiveness, chutzpah..
Mission - How bad you _want_ it. It's not the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog. Sometimes, just wanting it will be enough.

All these start as 1d6 straight rolls, calculate a modifier using the below table, Characters will use Fame to buy traits to augment these die rolls later. Characters with a net modifier less than a GM ordained value may be rerolled. 

| stat<br> | modifier | succeeds on     |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| 1        | -2       | 3+              |
| 2        | -1       | 4+              |
| 3        | 0        | 5+              |
| 4-5      | 1        | 6+              |
| 6-8      | 2        | 6+, fails on 1- |
| 9-12     | 3        | 6+, fail on 2-  |
| 13-15    | 4        |                 |
| 16-18    | 5        | 6+, fail on 3-  |
| 19+      | 6        |                 |
When you attempt to do something, roll d20 + the modifier for the relevant stat. The GM will compare this to a set DC. A GM may also ask for a 'vibes' roll. If so, roll a number of d6 equal to your stat value, you succeed when you net some positive number of successes. Any roll can be a "Check" or "Vibes" roll, though generally Checks are for where success should be super clear, and vibes where there is a spectrum. As the power of a character increases, the complexity of their vibes results in maintaining good vibes harder, thus the nerfing effect, but also because math.

Weaker characters usually succeed on vibes, because the fact that they're in these situations at all requires immaculate vibes.

In this system you don't level up, you either use fame to improve chargen, vesper to improve your current character, and gold to buy items and other necessaries to go get the other stuff. Vesper can be used to by, essentially, traits for your current character. This would include upkeep costs, in order to keep a stat boost, you need to pay some amount of vesper per day/week/whatever. It's another provision to track. These traits would be arbitrary, but I imagine a core one would be 'Skill' acquisition, gaining a specific additional modifier to a specific kind of task. The narrower, the cheaper.

Fighting:

Your total hit die is the sum of your modifiers, minimum one. All characters start with a d1 hit die, and proceed through d2, d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20 by exponentially more expensive trait. When you set off on an expedition, roll your hit die. This is your max HP until you end your current expedition. An expedition ends as with short/long rest in [[Hexcrawling]]. If you rest mid-trip, then you end a 'leg' of an expedition, this presently has no effects, but it may be useful to separate for traits (e.g., "When you finish a leg, roll your provisions die twice, keep either result."). Combat then D&D adjacent, maybe borrow from Knave?

Ideally combat is very OSR, but non-combat is more novel.

Intent:

Goal of Player is to take this process and make traits (for their order) or skills/feats/abilities to alter how they do check/vibes rolls. GMs should try to be in the business of saying either:

1. Yes, here is how much it costs based on how powerful it is, if it breaks these barriers or similar then we'll need to nerf it.
2. No, but here are some changes to this / way to get something similar.

The goal is to help the player build the cool character in a way that doesn't derail the GM. The game is high lethality for a reason, test drive traits as skills first, Vesper is a better power gate than Fame.

Magic:

It's ad hoc, staple on whatever you like. I guess this isn't so much a system as it is a starter kit. Build your own D&D.
