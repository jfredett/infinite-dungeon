Characters have 4 "Core Stats"

Mind - One's intellect, empathy, ability to communicate, charm.
Might - One's strength, of the coarse or fine muscles. A Bard's might is in the fine muscles, a Barbarian's in the large.
Mettle - One's inner strength, sticktoitiveness, chutzpah.
Mission - Whatever it is, this is _How bad you **want** it_. It's not the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog. Sometimes, just wanting it will be enough.

All these start as 1d6 straight rolls, calculate a modifier using the below table, Characters will use Fame to buy traits to augment these die rolls later. Characters with a net modifier less than a GM ordained value may be rerolled. 

> TODO: These should be associated with tuning info -- how likely is a d20 at DC whatever? What's the expected # of successes on a given roll? Especially as they start to nerf, those might be very aggressive or very generous, IDK. Vibes should be strong at low levels where knowing by how much one succeeds matters more -- later, vibes _failures_ are more interesting. Vibes are used when you need to know 'how bad it gets' -- at low levels this should generally be used as a way to lower the lethality, since the success rate is tuned upwards, later it should be used to show what happens when power is used unchecked. Vibes being used for mundane actions are a blessing and a curse. When you're a walking demigod with x-ray eyes, sometimes 'Investigation' becomes 'Unintentional Infliction of Cancer' because you can't contain your see-through powers when you fail a vibes check to x-ray something and accidentally irradiate a small town or something three blocks away. Oops, vibes checking 6d6 on a 6+ is very likely to show at least some successes.  See below for more.
> Ultimately this should be tuned such that the power curve almost crosses over, this is a significantly more 'powerful' system than typical D&D-style games as currently tuned, I want to tune things up just a smidge, because the players will start at extremely low values of these stats. I don't know exactly how often players should succeed roles generally, but in 5e, for instance, the base proficiency bonus is a +2, typical 'good stat' at level 1 is a +2, and my standard easy/medium/hard DCs are 12, 15, and 20. So the lowest chance of success at a thing you're 'good' at at level 1 in 5e is an effective 60%, 45%, 20% EMH. So probably somewhere between 60% or so.
> For the system as currently tabled below, a starting character could have as much as a +1, or as little as a -2 at level on for a Check
> It would have

When you attempt to do something, roll d20 + the modifier for the relevant stat. The GM will compare this to a set DC. A GM may also ask for a 'vibes' roll. If so, roll a number of d6 equal to your stat modifier, minimum 1, you succeed when you net some positive number of successes. Any roll can be a "Check" or "Vibes" roll, though generally Checks are for where success should be super clear, and vibes where there is a spectrum. As the power of a character increases, the complexity of their vibes results in maintaining good vibes harder, thus the nerfing effect, but also because math. Mission is a special stat, you use it when nothing else really applies, or as an optional bonus when helped by others -- you add the Mission of the player with the highest stat associated with the task they're assisting with, or if it's a specific player, add either their relevant stat, or mission, whichever is higher.

Checks overall represent different kinds of 'doing stuff', As characters progress and gain more stats, they will become more competent at 'accomplishing tasks' in whatever stat they focus in. Characters may acquire specific skills, so modifiers may grow quickly with DC, but the point is at some stage you don't need to check if the players can do most things with these characters, they are custom built demigods being run by people who have carefully negotiated their way to the exact thing they want to play; fully tested and tuned to the exact challenge they want to engage with. Just let them unlock the thing, of course they are hidden, of course. 

Instead, switch to vibes roles. Okay, you're hidden, what good does that do you when you emanate an aura of fear because you've been building a weird archdemon thing. The consequence of your presence itself is a vibes issue, you have accrued so much power that ruin walks in your wake, role vibes to understand that ruin's effect. These roles also get much easier to fail as time goes on, too much power makes playing the character harder, they have to adopt mad-wizard-y ways, become wanderers, traveling alone and trying to limit their scope. 






Weaker characters usually succeed on vibes, because the fact that they're in these situations at all requires immaculate vibes.

In this system you don't level up, you either use fame to improve chargen, vesper to improve your current character, and gold to buy items and other necessaries to go get the other stuff. Vesper can be used to by, essentially, traits for your current character. This would include upkeep costs, in order to keep a stat boost, you need to pay some amount of vesper per day/week/whatever. It's another provision to track. These traits would be arbitrary, but I imagine a core one would be 'Skill' acquisition, gaining a specific additional modifier to a specific kind of task. The narrower, the cheaper.

Fighting:

Your total hit die is the sum of your modifiers, minimum one of your choice.. All characters start with a d1 hit die, and proceed through d2, d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20 by exponentially more expensive trait. When you set off on an expedition, roll your hit die + a core stat of your choice (you can change this each time you set off^[GMs may use this as a requirement for a 'training' skill that requires an investment of time 'training' this state]). This is your max HP until you end your current expedition. An expedition ends as with short/long rest in [[Hexcrawling]]. If you rest mid-trip, then you end a 'leg' of an expedition, this presently has no effects, but it may be useful to separate for traits (e.g., "When you finish a leg, roll your provisions die twice, keep either result."). Combat then D&D adjacent, maybe borrow from Knave?

Ideally combat is very OSR, but non-combat is more novel.

Intent:

Goal of Player is to take this process and make traits (for their order) or skills/feats/abilities to alter how they do check/vibes rolls. GMs should try to be in the business of saying either:

1. Yes, here is how much it costs based on how powerful it is, if it breaks these barriers or similar then we'll need to nerf it.
2. No, but here are some changes to this / way to get something similar.

The goal is to help the player build the cool character in a way that doesn't derail the GM. The game is high lethality for a reason, test drive traits as skills first, Vesper is a better power gate than Fame.

Magic:

It's ad hoc, staple on whatever you like. I guess this isn't so much a system as it is a starter kit. Build your own D&D. Magic can be done like traits, a specific spell is created as a skill via Vesper/other expenditure.
