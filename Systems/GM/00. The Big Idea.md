# Preface

This book is mostly for GMs. The GM guide is first, the player stuff comes second. This is because I, like many reading this, am a Forever-GM. I have long-ago accepted this fate, and while I am not yet unto Arcadia, I suspect that GMing will find me there too. Many know this blessing and curse, I write this book for you.

This chapter will not be like the other chapters. For reasons far outside the scope of this book, it feels necessary for me to try to, at least once, convey to you the _why_ of this work; the rest will concern itself only with the _whats_ and _hows_. This kind of thing is generally an antipattern, but I'm doing it anyway because it's my book and no one can tell me not to.
# What is the _Infinite Dungeon_?

_Infinite Dungeon_'s is a system that supports a GM by constantly feeding back new raw material; building settings that can contain stories across systems, genres, and even across GMs; and providing an evolving experience for players, so that the larger universe doesn't get too stale.

ID is mostly system agnostic it can be used in part or in whole, it provides a minimalistic resolution system to support one of the main tools of ID: Orders, an evolving character generation ruleset using another foundational mechanic -- using an inflationary resource economy to control balance of characters. The minimalistic system can be replaced with a minimized version of any system. Orders are used to build up the character generation process to favor the kind of character the player wants to play. ID's core mechanic is actually a negotiation system centered around a GM-controlled inflationary resource economy.

# Why is _Infinite Dungeon_?

Almost every GM has had an experience like the following, often they've been on both sides of it, in fact. A player comes to you a week before a session 0, they have written a tome containing dozens of diagrams, chapters of backstory, a full family tree, or some other pile of beautiful nonsense. If you're the player, you are bound for disappointment, there is no world in which your GM can internalize that story the way you want them too. If you're a GM, you're probably a mixture of terrified and distraught at the idea of having to let this PC down, and how that might play out.

Instead, I want to be able to tell that player, "This is a great idea, how do you plan to build this? Let's start from the _beginning_ of this order, so when the Last Scion of House Whateverthehell comes around, it hits like a hammer, instead of a pillow." Orders represent a methodical way to tailor a character to the _exact_ power fantasy they envision, the resource economy that drives it is designed to allow the GM to place reins on each order individually and incrementally; allowing both loosening of an individual player who the GM thinks may be underpowered, and curtailing a player that has managed to get too strong. It provides narrative mechanical justification to apply priority targeting to those more powerful players, and most importantly, it makes the moment of _loss_ of that character a _heavily rewarded_ moment. The culmination of the work of that PC's life is about to pay off, and the Player about to see what comes out of the loot pinata as they get to build a new character with all the new traits they negotiate for. Every step of the process is aimed to come with a new reward, which keeps everyone always looking forward to what's next. We end up with a gameplay loop like:

# What makes _Infinite Dungeon_ work?

Three things, a resource system tweak inspired by MMORPGs; a Character Generation tweak that grows out of a desire to codify a system for building homebrew in a balanced way; and a West-Marches approach to game management called the "Shared Tablematic Universe for Playing Infinite Dungeon." 

## Resources

Resources have two important modes, a Narrative Mode and a Platonic Mode. The narrative modality of a resource is whether or not _characters_ know about it in the world. Characters do not know about the Dice the players throw, but they know about the sword they use that gets to do the damage dictated by those dice. The sword is diegetic, the dice are nondiegetic.

Platonic modality indicates whether or not the resource is a _physical object_ or if it's simply an _abstract_ idea. Things which are not abstract are _concrete_. Ducats and Vesper (Gold and XP) also work like this, though they are diegetic, concrete resources, so when a character dies, they are dealt with as normal loot. Fame is abstract (like XP in other TTRPGs), but still diegetic in some sense. Fame represents how well known the order is. The Jesuits are a famous Order of the Catholic Church; the members of First Bible Baptist in Podunksville, USA is an order not particularly famous, ostensibly Baptist denomination of Protestant Christianity. One is more famous than the other, he same holds true for PCs. If a PC is a member of an Order with a lot of accrued Fame, they are literally, diegetically, more recognizable than another character with far less. This means that other NPCs in the world are somewhat justified in 'knowing' more things about players of particularly famous orders, offering some narrative cover to targeting an overpowered character.

Below is a table showing some classifications of resources across games.

|             | Narrative   | Platonic | Use                           |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ducats (ID) | Diegetic    | Concrete | Monetary Exchange             |
| Vesper (ID) | Diegetic    | Concrete | Projects, Leveling Characters |
| Fame (ID)   | Diegetic    | Abstract | Order building/Chargen        |
| XP (5e)     | Nondiegetic | Abstract | Leveling Characters           |
| Gold (5e)   | Diegetic    | Concrete | Monetary Exchange             |
## Orders

Orders are a way to codify a homebrew character build. It's designed to also give back to the GM narratively and mechanically. Let's look at an example. Say you have built an order of Assassin Rogues over a dozen characters, and it is now the most powerful and famous group of assassins in the whole world. However, the other powerful members of the old ruling class of order decides your current character, who has started as a lowly footpad and climbed to the position of _Capo di tutti Capi_ through violence and skullduggery, should be killed. I, as the GM, can now rattle off a bunch of assassins _from your order_, and have you as the PC figure out how to deal with these rebellious gangsters who are trying to kill you. I already have all the tools I need to build characters that fit with the story that players wants to tell. I can populate the world with them, I can combine them with characters of other orders, etc. The player provides the framework, the GM uses it to rapidly create interesting characters at power levels that the Player has been testing for us the whole time. The various traits of the order generally can't all be activated at once, so there is variety within the order, allowing both player and GM to create small variations while still maintaining the spirit of the order narratively. I want other members of your Order to look like you intend, but not like you necessarily expect.

## Shared Tablematic Universe for Playing Infinite Dungeon

Players are responsible for the overall story arc of their orders, GMs are responsible for providing obstacles and resistance to those goals so that they are narratively satisfying to accomplish. This extends outward from a core idea present in the _West Marches_-style of play. In _West Marches_-style play, _players_ come up with goals and proactively find parties and schedule them; sessions are often one- or few-shot affairs which have a concrete goal that the PCs want to accomplish. In traditional WM, these are persistent characters, and it's possible that players have more than one PC; maybe if multi-level play is involved, etc. In _Infinite Dungeon_, this idea is expanded. Players might have more than one Order, but they will likely go through very many PCs. The _Order_ has the goal traditionally ascribed to the PC, so when a _Player_ wants to accomplish a goal, it can be at the level of either the Character (i.e., to make progress on a personal project), or the Order itself (i.e., to work towards one of the high level goals of the order), and as such it may be that the player wants to build a character _specifically for_ some goal, that's fine, because they are built out of the order and the player must spend Fame to create these characters. The fame is returned to the order (ideally with interest) only at character death; so often these one-shots may result in characters actively sacrificing themselves in various hilarious ways so the player can use the fame again. GMs should tax PCs who fail to die in interesting ways, no walking off cliffs.

It is likely that Players will become attached to, and protect, specific PCs this way. That is encouraged. Part of the intended fun of ID is the idea of 'getting one over' on the GM. It is a big moment when a player manages to use the mechanics of the system; their skill at roleplaying; or their pure, unbridled chutzpah to overcome a challenge in a way the GM was not expecting. Overpowered builds are _fun like fireworks_ -- brilliant, but only because they don't last very long. ID wants to help keep these events from overstaying their welcome.

All of this comes together under the helm of some generic rules for navigating an otherwise openended universe. It is designed to accommodate multiple kinds of travel; traditional hexcrawling, fast-travel hexcrawling, depth-crawl based through alternative "Perpendicular" realities a la _The Garden of Ynn_ or _The Stygian Library_, and other modes of travel. It's similarly designed to incorporate _arbitrary modules from arbitrary systems with no conversions (unless you want to)_. The universe of _ID_ is, canonically, not wed to any one system. Every system of magic from every game everywhere at all times is Canon in _Infinite Dungeon_.

> **_Everything_ is canon in   _I N F I N I T E   D U N G E O N_**

This means, to me, that you should _routinely_ have, e.g., your DCC characters interact with your D&D characters interacting with your SWN characters interacting with your so on and so forth. You should not mix systems when doing adventures, but there is no reason not to let them interact outside of that. Most of the resources in _ID_ are designed to be generic and adjusted to in-system on the fly. The GM is once again empowered with a balancing stick in an inflationary economy to maintain proper resource conversion rates, but ultimately the process is "Stick a signpost in the world for an adventure, or when an adventure starts, clearly delineate whatever resource and system requirements you have."

This lets me, as a GM, happily traipse over my whole collection of games, but keep a single narrative thread. It also makes space for other GMs in the same shared universe.

Fundamentally, TTRPGs are _games_, and I want all my _games_ to be in one big world so I can smash my G.I. Joes together with my Dinosaurs together with my Lego. I don't think that requires any more justification.
