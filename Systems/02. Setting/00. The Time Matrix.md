Eret has many time reckonings. Here things are generally accurate to within a year. The Earth Date equivalent is precise unless prefixed with a `c`. All dates are approximate if the Earth date is approximate; otherwise the event occurred within a window specified by the precision.

Distinct from our world, Magic was at the center of this rise. The SPQR formed as a check against the Magical Warlords that ruled the Italian Peninsula prior. Legendarily, Romulus and Remus, raised by Wolves, were immune to the magic of the warlords, and slew them, forming the twin cities of Rome and Reme (located roughly where Naples is). Reme was then sacked by Neheb, leading to a revenge war by Rome, who built a Navy out of nothing and sacked Neheb, pushing it to general irrelevance for the final time.                                                                                                                                                                          |

The office of Caesar Augustus is preserved as a sort of figurehead/head of State, in honor of his humility. This figure holds immense social power in the Empire. Augustus retires to the Alps, and has not been heard of since. Some civilians believe he may return someday to banish Magic from the world and create a _Nova Pax Romana_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

He still sits in the Senate of Rome today, presiding over the Catholic Pantheon as _Primus inter pares_ of the College of Cardinals (which he founded) and the SPQR. He is a de facto dictator, but one of Aristotle's "Philosopher Kings".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The Pantheon does not worship the _actual_ gods. It's something Aurelius came up with when trying to build a government for 'normal' people. Aurelius was, himself, magically adept; but his only manifested power was immortality/invulnerability; and no other power (besides, perhaps, an above average intellect). He used these powers to develop systems and organizations that could band together 'average human power' into something that could resist the magical warlords that tended to rule (including the legendary kings of Rome, and even Augustus himself).       |
