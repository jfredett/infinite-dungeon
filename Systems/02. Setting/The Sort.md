> You're probably from around here, maybe a few hundred kilometers at most. You've probably all got roughly the same story. You were born to [[G - Glossary#Mundane|Mundane]] parents, but you weren't. You probably first noticed your abilities as a teen, if you were lucky you were able to hide them for a while, if you were really lucky you were already independent of your parents and had enough time and privacy to _practice_; but inevitably, your preternatural or even outright magical ability was discovered, and in accordance with the thousand year old custom, you were given a few days rations, some simple gear, a weapon, and a kick out of town. "None of the Adventuring Sort Here" -- written on signs outside villages, towns, and all but the largest settlements of the Mundane world. Whatever you were -- now you are just one of the Sort.

> You probably have spent the last few weeks wandering, following roads pointing to different Inns, hunting -- if you can; foraging too. To be honest, it's a miracle you didn't die on the first trek, an astonishment that you made it to the second. You're honestly starting to think you might have a chance at this life. Along the way you've found friends, we'll learn those stories as we play, but for now it's enough to know there is strength in numbers, especially as neophyte, unaffiliated adventurer. You'll need to find an [[02. Orders|Order]] to join, or maybe you'll found one of your own (or perhaps with your friends).
