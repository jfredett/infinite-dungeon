## Weather

Below is historical data for a local town.

https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/worcester/KORH/date/1949-6-26

Use the current date with this dataset, for each area, choose an appropriate town with the climate you like, pick a starting year, and just follow the chart. When you run out (if you run out), switch to another town with similar weather and start again.

You may notice that older years have cooler climate/different weather patterns. Blame Captialism.

When gathering weather information, gather the following:

1. Temp
2. Barometric Pressure
3. Wind Strength and Direction
4. Precipitation amount
5. Dawn/Sunset times
6. Moon phase
7. Humidity

The charts have these values down to time-of-day. These seven values have corresponding categories as follows:

These can also be pulled per hour from this site, so you can adjust as needed.

- Temp
	- Frigid (<-10C)
	- Cold (-10C - 10C)
	- Chilly (10C - 15C)
	- Cool (15C-20C)
	- Warm (20C-25C)
	- Hot (25C-35C)
	- Sweltering (35C+)
- Humidity, only relevant if it's Cool or warmer.
	- 0% - 20%: Dry, Arid. Hotter temps more bearable, but easier to become exhausted
	- 20% - 40%: Pleasant, unnoticed humidity.
	- 40% - 60%: Getting sticky, not as pleasant
	- 60% - 80%: Swampy, soupy, sweaty.
	- 80% - 90%: Misery made manifest
	- 90% - 99%: Burgeoning on immediate rainfall; hot fog; might as well be an oversteamed sauna.

	- Average baro reading is ~1013.25 at sea level
	- Lower than average indicates higher likelihood of a storm soon. Animals may be running for shelter, birds may be quieter, old wounds and injuries may hurt more.
	- Ideally you would assess the baro reading as sigmas-relative-to-the-mean. i.e., "The baro is 2$\sigma$ below normal, indicating a major storm is coming"
	- Players unlikely to have this info, mostly for encounter tweaking and narrative.

Overall flow:

![[Hexcrawl Procedure]]

## Checklist

### Standard Travel

- [ ] Party: Determine Route, Scout, and any Cartographers, communicate to GM
- [ ] GM: Note current date, determine DC for navigation roll based on Terrain, Current Weather conditions
- [ ] Scout: Roll Navigation
- [ ] GM: mark time based on terrain, exploration status, etc
- [ ] GM: Inform players of their new hex
- [ ] If players are in a previously explored hex, tell them, even if they were lost.
- [ ] GM: If terrain needs to be generated, generate it
- [ ] GM: Generate current weather
- [ ] Scout: Roll D20
- [ ] GM: DC is roll under number of prior marks. On success, hex is explored. If the party was lost, they aren't anymore.
- [ ] GM: Check Encounter, Generate and Resolve as needed, this consumes downtime if there was any to be had.
- [ ] GM: After the encounter is resolved, as the scout if they intend to explore or not. If they don't, travel may continue or the players may move to a rest/downtime mode.
- [ ] Return to Start with updated weather, time.
### Resting in the Wild

Branching from step

- [ ] Scout: Inform the GM you intend to rest.
- [ ] GM: Mark current date and weather
- [ ] GM: Check for encounter
- [ ] If encounter, resolve, check provisions, and return to start.
- [ ] If no encounter, check to see if this is the third consecutive short rest in the same location without interruption
	- [ ] If so, long rest
	- [ ] else, short rest
- [ ] Return to Start
### Resting at a Safe Zone

- Party: Inform of Long Rest
- GM: Check [[Safety Rating]] of location, roll against safety, if it passes, long rest. Otherwise generate encounter.
- After encounter, long rest guaranteed, increase safety rating, etc.

## Exploration Time Table

Same as travel time, nets 1 mark.

# Non-travel options

Parties may time working on downtime projects. Each project taxes an attribute (based on relevant skill check), when the character has done 8 hours of downtime work, they cannot do any more of that kind without taking a level of exhaustion. Similarly, if they do not sleep at least 8 hours they take a level of exhaustion. Otherwise, while in a safe location, they may work as much as they like.

# Safety Rating

Every location sufficient for a long rest has a Safety Rating, the Safety Rating is a Usage Die that upgrades after a resolved encounter at the safe location. Every day the party stays at a safe location, roll the Safety Rating Die, if it downgrades, the safe location is attacked/subject to the consequence of a random encounter.

Alternatively, create a hazard elsewhere in the world that will eventually threaten the players.

Notes here

```

The overworld map is fixed wrt general terrain type; e.g., is this a forest-heavy region, arid, etc. Each hex on this map represents 50km^2 of area, divided into 5km^2 hexes; generally focusing on the 'important' subregion of 20-40km^2 worth of hexes in the region (4 hex <-> 8 hex wide area maps). Each area map has:

1. A climate -- referring to the seasonal average temperature, rainfall, etc
2. A biome -- referring to the kinds of flora and fauna that make this place their home
3. Weather -- both hex specific, but local hexes should tend to have the same current weather, and should adhere to the centerpoints that are their climate values.
4. Settlement -- a scale of how settled the area is, most places are sparsely populated.
5. Topography -- details about elevation, geologic factors, etc.

The goal is to use something like a dice-driven WFC algorithm, tuned by these hyperparameters. The GM can make the overworld map however they like, key it, and assign climate, biome, and whatever else they may want, then WFC to get the rest.

It should be something like: Roll 3d6, then look on each of `n` tables and count votes based on the value you got; then do instant runoff on the result. So you'd have a table for each climate to specify the 'ungenerated tile' table, then for each terrain type in that table you have a second table which contains the 'vote' of that cell. The runoff should be set to a tunable 'threshold' parameter. So take a 'Dense Forest' climate table like:

This may be expanded/contracted, die can be adjusted to have a narrower/broader distribution, but fundamentally each climate is one of these tables, and then subsequent rolls should use the other tables as mentioned.

These are biome-tables, the set of available biome tables may vary by climate region (and on borders, it might make sense to use both). Similarly, weather and settlement info can adjust the inner checks to select secondary tables.

It would be extra cool to include further-away hexes as a reduced-value vote (e.g., inverse square), so that change is kept pretty slow.

That would require significant automation, though.
