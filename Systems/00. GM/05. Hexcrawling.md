The overworld map is fixed wrt general terrain type; e.g., is this a forest-heavy region, arid, etc. Each hex on this map represents 50km^2 of area, divided into 5km^2 hexes; generally focusing on the 'important' subregion of 20-40km^2 worth of hexes in the region (4 hex <-> 8 hex wide area maps). Each area map has:

1. A climate -- referring to the seasonal average temperature, rainfall, etc
2. A biome -- referring to the kinds of flora and fauna that make this place their home
3. Weather -- both hex specific, but local hexes should tend to have the same current weather, and should adhere to the centerpoints that are their climate values.
4. Settlement -- a scale of how settled the area is, most places are sparsely populated.
5. Topography -- details about elevation, geologic factors, etc.

The goal is to use something like a dice-driven WFC algorithm, tuned by these hyperparameters. The GM can make the overworld map however they like, key it, and assign climate, biome, and whatever else they may want, then WFC to get the rest.

It should be something like: Roll 3d6, then look on each of `n` tables and count votes based on the value you got; then do instant runoff on the result. So you'd have a table for each climate to specify the 'ungenerated tile' table, then for each terrain type in that table you have a second table which contains the 'vote' of that cell. The runoff should be set to a tunable 'threshold' parameter. So take a 'Dense Forest' climate table like:

This may be expanded/contracted, die can be adjusted to have a narrower/broader distribution, but fundamentally each climate is one of these tables, and then subsequent rolls should use the other tables as mentioned.

These are biome-tables, the set of available biome tables may vary by climate region (and on borders, it might make sense to use both). Similarly, weather and settlement info can adjust the inner checks to select secondary tables.

It would be extra cool to include further-away hexes as a reduced-value vote (e.g., inverse square), so that change is kept pretty slow.

That would require significant automation, though.
