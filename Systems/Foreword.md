_Infinite Dungeon_ is the sum of all of my game-mastering and game-thinking, really. It's every campaign, every source book, every single thing I've ever done in TTRPGs shoved into one, admittedly quite large, dungeon.

I do not know if anything will ever come of all this effort, but I got quite tired of having it scattered all over the place, so now it's all here.

Someday I'll write a better foreword, today isn't it.
