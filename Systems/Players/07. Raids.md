Draft

```

Repeatable, Action-oriented, Iterated Dungeons

Intended to be repeated multiple times, intentionally overtuned.

Multiple 'modes', an Intro so I can show you roughly whats available, scripted death will be telegraphed for this mode if there is one, good way to cash in a character.

Normal/Heroic/Mythic for bigger fame rewards/better loot


May have entry requirements, including:

1. System the characters entering are using
2. Level reqs within that system
3. Minimum Fame reqs
4. Arbitrary other narrative requirements

These are intended to be a way to test characters and give you an easy way to cash in a character you think is likely to die and is also saddled with a lot of fame you want to use.
