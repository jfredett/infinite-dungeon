Perpendicularity is not Parallelity. Different Topoi, have to invoke secondary reaction principle.
Seven layers of horcra needed, not SIX!

> Here a diagram depicting some sort of door is shown.

The Sidhe could do it, why can't I! Cave Magic, it must be Cave Magic.

[ED: In this section is reproduced a large body of text in an unknown and untranslated script. Significant work must be
done to study and understand it. A note follows]

[ED: Scribbled, in another hand, are some diagrams with large labels showing "Parallel" realities, "Perpendicular"
realities, and beneath them a more general "Rotated Realities", the lines connecting them are labelled "M" with
prime subscripts, The conjoined "Rotated Reality" has an abstract suffix `n`, and is adjoined by `n = ` the product of
the other subscripts]

[ED: Some complex symbols continue in `gtg`'s hand. The copyist reproduces them exactly. The script then returns to the
Wizard's hand, a brief amount of untranslated text with notes written above them, then a translation]

Induce via eddy currents at the leylines, like spinning a top...

[ED: An interrupted note returns from above]
