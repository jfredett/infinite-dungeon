One of the doors in the basement level of Hilbert's leads to an Apple-store-like place with lots of little magic
dioramas showing different types of things for locking doors, securing facilities, and so on. Several scrolls of
magic-eye and seeing are on display, Some are quite small and are designed to be fit in a front pocket for quick access,
others are page-sized but have nicer text layout and a shinier ink.

Meandering around the store are several goblins in polo shirts and khakis talking to customers of various flavor. One
of them will greet the players slightly before they're ready.

The store is a brick and mortar for Ollam's Deviantproof Doorways, Inc. In the back there is another doorway that leads
to the Head Office, and from there to the C-Suite, which is where the C-Suite have there offices, and from Ollam's
office there (which is in the Janitor closet) is a final door that leads to a small lab where Ollam works.
