# Hilbert's Hotel

aka: The Infinite Hallway, Hilbert's Hotel, the Back Rooms. L'h√¥tel Hilbert.

Hilbert's Hotel is the centerpoint of the Infinite Dungeon, it was made my the Mad Wizard in his attempt to replicate
the "Cave Magic" that created the Gardens of Ynn and the Stygian Library. It is a strange, partial facsimile.

Getting to Hilbert's Hotel involves finding a place of temporary dwelling -- a Hotel, Motel, Inn or Tavern, etc -- and
looking for an out of place door often in the middle of the hall of rooms, that only appears once you walk past it, it
will have no opposite equivalent, and will appear in the space between two rooms. Place any key in the door and turn
counter clockwise. The door will open into either the foyer of Hilbert's Hotel (if you're lucky (DC20)), in which case the door
will still be available behind you and you may immediately return to the Real World, or -- vastly more likely, you'll
end up in a random [[Hilbert's Hallway]]

Exiting Hilbert's Hotel is not straightforward, and you must find an exit door. Fortunately, Hilbert's Hotel has exit
signs over some of the doors, unfortunately, these are often regional, meaning they don't necessarily look like an exit
sign, they may not be in a comprehensible language, they may use arcane or obtuse symbology, but sufficiently clever
adventurers may learn what they look like over time.

## The Staff

### The Hotel Manager

Unnamed, unseen, may be DDD himself

### The Concierge

Tim Curry-esque, very formal, very proper, somewhat menacing

### The Bellboy

A sycophant to the Concierge

### The Help

A kind, androgynous individual in hotel cleaning staff uniform. They may offer to clean something for the party,
removing it's magical effects (curse or blessing) and returning a mundane object after a quick scrub with their cloth.

Doesn't get along with The Concierge or the Bellboy

May be a multiple-person, you're never quite sure, you often see them walking away right from you in the distance as
they are also beginning to talk to you in your proximity.
