## The Staff

### The Hotel Manager

Unnamed, unseen, may be DDD himself

### The Concierge

Tim Curry-esque, very formal, very proper, somewhat menacing

### The Bellboy

A sycophant to the Concierge

### The Help

A kind, androgynous individual in hotel cleaning staff uniform. They may offer to clean something for the party,
removing it's magical effects (curse or blessing) and returning a mundane object after a quick scrub with their cloth.

Doesn't get along with The Concierge or the Bellboy

May be a multiple-person, you're never quite sure, you often see them walking away right from you in the distance as
they are also beginning to talk to you in your proximity.
