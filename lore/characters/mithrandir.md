Mithrandir is known across the multiverse as an itinerant wanderer and friend of all who find need of friendship. He has
gone by many names and colors, but it is important to understand that, like all Wizards of his kind and caliber,
Mithrandir is not confined to merely a single existence, indeed, he is not even confined to a single existence _at a
time_. Those of the Valinorian persuasion are not individual creatures as such, but rather a gestalt of many creatures
across many timelines and within many universes. Mithrandir, or 'Wanderer' refers to this fact. While in one reality he
may have fought a Balrog from the depths of Moria to the height of Zirakzigil along Durin's endless stair, in this world
he is more preoccupied with the doings of a certain Mad Wizard.

Mithrandir has met himself on occasion, and has only had this to say on the matter:

> I do not recommend it, bad for the sense of self.
