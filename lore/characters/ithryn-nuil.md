The Ithryn Nuil is an anonymous academic collective of wizards, magi, witches, and other delvers of the arcane; based at
the Southron University of the Arcane Arts (SUAA).

The "I.N." as they are typically known, will collaborate internally, and sign their work with simple letter initials,
`ain` for the first author, `bin` for the second, etc. In the original texts these are unique marks, but analysis of the
text indicates that they were not uniquely applied. The order is secret, and the members are bound by magical pact to
never reveal their identities. It is not known why this is done, though many speculate it is to avoid aggrandizement and
inflation of ego.

The "Blue Wizards" as they are sometimes known for their propensity to write in blue ink, seal with blue wax, etc; are
well regarded in the Magical world as expert scholars with a unique perspective owing to their relative distance and
disconnection from the broader world. Connected, but separate, they are able to provide insight, often have alternative
resources otherwise unaccessible or lost to those in the parts of the world our story considers. They are known to have
a close relationship, as a collective, with [[Mithrandir]], the Grey Wizard.
