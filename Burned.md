(from [here](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Additional_Status_Conditions_(5e_Variant_Rule)#Burning))

- A creature that comes under the effect of the burned condition takes one of the three degrees of this condition based on the amount of fire damage they took equal to their maximum hit points. When you take a degree of burned you take all lower degrees of burn. For example, if you had 100 hit points and took 51 fire damage, you would be affected by second and first-degree.
- First Degree: 25%: Your skin becomes bright pink or very red. You have [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage") on your next weapon attack roll. You have [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage") on [Charisma](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Charisma "5e SRD:Charisma") checks.
- Second Degree: 50%: Your skin becomes red as blisters begin to form on the affected area. You have [disadvantage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Disadvantage "5e SRD:Disadvantage") on [Dexterity](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Dexterity "5e SRD:Dexterity") saving throws and ability checks. Your speed is also halved.
- Third Degree: 75%: Your skin is seared black as the fire nearly consumes you. Make a [Constitution](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Constitution "5e SRD:Constitution") saving throw, versus the spell save DC or a DC appropriate for the source (DM fiat), or the pain, becomes too much to handle and you pass out for an hour, falling [prone](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Prone "5e SRD:Conditions") and becoming [unconscious](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Unconscious "5e SRD:Conditions"). On a successful save, you are not affected.
- Healing via magic reduces your burned level by one per each 25% of your hit points it heals. Healing via natural means recovers one level per long rest, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Spells like [_lesser restoration_](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Lesser_Restoration "5e SRD:Lesser Restoration") can remove one level of this condition, while something like greater restoration can remove it all at once. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by one, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.
- Creatures that are immune to fire damage are immune to this condition. While creatures that are resistant to fire damage require 25% more of their hit point maximum to be affected by a level. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage and 50% of its hit point maximum was just taken in fire damage it would have the first-degree burned condition.
