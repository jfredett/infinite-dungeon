- Athul re'Athir
	- formal (short) court name [[The Mad Wizard Dracul Drathulu Drathir]]
	- a full formal court name would require the recitation of all the honors, titles, services, orders, milieu, and other such awards presented by each of the last Seven Dukes to the interlocuter. A few hundred years ago there was a rapid succession of dukes of different houses each increasingly giving out more and more absurd titles to stymie their opponents from ever being able to make a point, limiting their ability to influence government; This led to the 'short' version, listing only what the individual considers their most relevant or important title, followed by a simple mention of the house they are affiliated with and roughly how important they are, by use of a particle.
		- Changing ones 'first' name is therefore often a symbolic choice
	- I think of the `re'` particle as implying 'in the service of' the 'Athir', which is a proper name of a house.
	- Athul in this case is a personal name or maybe a title of this house, I don't have a clear idea yet.
- Retha re'Zanzir
	- formal (short) court name of [[Parmadil]] in Edomic
- Retha/Rethri - "Healer"/"Medic" - in the sense of someone who gets their hands dirty, not an administrator, someone who works. Used by a particular school of medicine within Edom.
- Athul - "Sunhawk" - a type of preening bird of prey/carrion bird that lived on the coasts near Edom. Used for a person who is self-absorbed

# Formal Names

People who work for the great houses of Edom are considered as people only in the context of their service of the job they do for the house. So "Parmadil" (also a psuedonym) is "Retha re'Zanzir", and his colleague is "Rethri re'Arulen". 
# Orthography

Old Aramaic/Syriac script, but modified to be cursive. Often embellished as with Illuminations in old manuscripts.
