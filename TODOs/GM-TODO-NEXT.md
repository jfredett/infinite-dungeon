	- [ ] Skybridge Depth
		- [ ] Improve Macros to roll on the depth chart
			- [ ] Maybe make these create journal entries?
				- just update a journal entry automatically with a log of the die roll + result, chapter per roll or whatever. I can add notes there and figure out how to export it back out.
				- It'd be cool if it tracked it more nonlinearly, maybe creating items that reference each other dynamically? Items that can be found in the dungeon later?
- [ ] Non-Raid stuff
	- [ ] Rename towns/cities away from real names
	- [ ] Improve Macro/move to script the Iron Roller, add some trait support?
